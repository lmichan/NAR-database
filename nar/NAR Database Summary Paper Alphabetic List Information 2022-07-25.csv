In order to overcome these limitations, we constructed a database named 3DIV (a 3D-genome Interaction Viewer and database) that provides a list of long-range chromatin interaction partners for the queried locus with genomic and epigenomic annotations. 3DIV is the first of its kind to collect all publicly available human Hi-C data to provide 66 billion uniformly processed raw Hi-C read pairs obtained from 80 different human cell/tissue types.

Especially for miRNAs, one class of small non-coding RNAs, many algorithms have been developed to predict new candidates from next-generation sequencing data. While the amount of publications describing novel miRNA candidates keeps steadily increasing, the current gold standard database for miRNAs - miRBase - has not been updated since June 2014. As a result, publications describing new miRNA candidates in the last three to five years might have a substantial overlap of candidates without noticing. With miRCarta we implemented a database to collect novel miRNA candidates and augment the information provided by miRBase. In the first stage, miRCarta is thought to be a highly sensitive collection of potential miRNA candidates with a high degree of analysis functionality, annotations and details on each miRNA. We addedâ€”besides the full content of the miRBaseâ€”12,857 human miRNA precursors to miRCarta. Users can match their own predictions to the entries of miRCarta to reduce potential redundancies in their studies. miRCarta provides the most comprehensive collection of human miRNAs and miRNA candidates to form a basis for further refinement and validation studies.

Despite this critical situation, new drug development projects have been inadequate for reasons ranging from bad selection of targets to reduced antimicrobial drug discovery efforts by pharmaceutical companies (2, 3). Currently, it is accepted that identification and validation of appropriate targets are critical steps for designing new drugs. In this sense, Next Generation Sequencing is increasingly aiding the evaluation of gene function, essentiality and suitability for drug development. Nevertheless there is a lack of online resources that allows genome wide based data consolidation from diverse sources in order to define a list of potential targets. Here, we present Target-Pathogen database (target.sbg.qb.fcen.uba.ar/patho), an online resource that allows genome wide based target ranking and identification. By integrating and weighting the data, focusing on essentiality, metabolic role and structural druggability prediction of proteins, Target-Pathogen facilitates the identification and prioritization of candidate targets suitable for new drug development projects.
Available genomic data for pathogens has created new opportunities for drug discovery and development to fight them, including new resistant and multiresistant strains. In particular structural data must be integrated with both, gene information and experimental results. In this sense, there is a lack of an online resource that allows genome wide based data consolidation from diverse sources together with thorough bioinformatic analysis that allows easy filtering and scoring for fast target selection for drug discovery. Here, we present Target-Pathogen database (http://target.sbg.qb.fcen.uba.ar/patho), designed and developed as an online resource that allows the integration and weighting of protein information such as: function, metabolic role, off-targeting, structural properties including druggability, essentiality, and omic experiments, to facilitate the identification and prioritization of candidate drug targets in pathogens. We include in the database ten genomes of some of the most relevant microorganisms for human health (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Plasmodium vivax, Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania major, Wolbachia bancrofti, Trypanosoma brucei, Shigella dysenteriae and Schistosoma Smanosoni) and show its applicability. New genomes can be uploaded upon request.
Target-Pathogen is an easy-to-use web-based platform which allows genome wide based data consolidation from diverse sources in a user-friendly manner , with graphical interface for structural visualization and manipulation. With structurome and drugome information Target-Pathogen is a unique resource to analyze whole genomes of relevant pathogens. Using Target-Pathogen, researchers can quickly prioritize genes of interest in a fast and intuitive manner, running simple queries (such as looking for proteins with high druggability score or associated with choke-points reactions), filtering by different data, assigning numerical weights for different properties and combining these results to produce a ranked list of targets. In this sense, an aspect that distinguishes Target- Pathogen is that it permits users to upload their own data. Once the data is uploaded, it can be included to obtain a personalized ranking of candidate drug targets in pathogens. Another key feature where Target-Pathogen stands alone is its ability to rank not only proteins but entire pathways. This characteristic allows prioritizing promising pathways to develop new drugs in order to synergistically attack several proteins of the same pathway. We have now selected ten relevant genomes but the database can be easily updated with other relevant pathogens as the bioinformatic pipelines have been automatized. In this sense, we will extend Target-Pathogen to more organisms than the current version, that's why we also encourages users to request new genomes of interest and join our team by mailing to target@biargentina.com.ar.
The goal of Target-Pathogen is not to replace wet strategies for target identification. Rather, our goal is to become a useful resource for researchers working in the field of target identification and/or drug discovery to translate biological questions in a computational tractable way by exploring, filtering and weighting the vast quantity of genome-scale data sets.

Herein, we report GPCRome-wide homology models of unprecedented quality, and roughly 150 000 GPCR ligands with data on biological activities and commercial availability. Based on the strategy of â€™Less model â€“ more Xtalâ€™, each model exploits both a main template and alternative local templates.

Models are provided for inactive, intermediate and active statesâ€”except for classes C and F that so far only have inactive templates. The ligand database has separate browsers for: (i) target selection by receptor, family or class, (ii) ligand filtering based on cross-experiment activities (min, max and mean) or chemical properties, (iii) ligand source data and (iv) commercial availability. SMILES structures and activity spreadsheets can be downloaded for further processing. Furthermore, three recent landmark publications on GPCR drugs, G protein selectivity and genetic variants have been accompanied with resources that now let readers view and analyse the findings themselves in GPCRdb.

Identification and annotation of regulators in Ub/Ubl systems is fundamental for understanding the molecular mechanisms of Ub/Ubl conjugations, and provides a highly useful reservoir for discovering disease biomarkers and drug targets. In 2013, we reported a family-based database of UUCD 1.0 for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like conjugations, containing 738 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1s), 2,937 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), 46,631 ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s) and 6,647 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in 70 eukaryotes (1), whereas proteins with ubiquitin domains (UBDs) and ubiquitin-like domains (ULDs) were not included at that time (2,3). In this update, we greatly improved our previous database, and provided a much more comprehensive resource of iUUCD 2.0 (http://iuucd.biocuckoo.org/). Firstly, 27 E1s, 109 E2s, 1,153 E3s, 164 DUBs, 396 UBDs and 183 ULDs were collected from scientific literatures and classified into 1, 4, 23, 8, 27, 11 families, respectively. Secondly, HMM identification and ortholog search were adopted to detect the potential regulators. Ultimately, the iUUCD 2.0 totally contains 136,512 regulators in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, including 1,230 E1s, 5,636 E2s, 93,343 E3s, 9,548 DUBs, 30,173 UBDs and 11,099 ULDs in 148 eukaryotic species. In particular, we provided rich annotations for regulators of eight model organisms, especially in humans, by compiling and integrating the knowledge from nearly 70 widely used public databases that cover (i) Cancer Mutations, including ICGC, COSMIC, TCGA, CGAP and IntOGen; (ii) Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), such as dbSNP; (iii) mRNA Expression, including GEO, ArrayExpress, GXD, FFGED, TCGA, ICGC, COSMIC, HUMAN PROTEOME MAP and The Human Protein Atlas; (iv) DNA and RNA Elements, including UTRdb, AREsite, JASPAR CORE, circBase, circRNADb, CircNet, Circ2Traits, miRTarBase, microRNA.org, TRANSFAC, miRWalk, TargetScan, miRecords, RepTar, miRNAMap, SomamiR DB 2.0, miRcode, RAID v2.0 and LncRNADisease; (v) Protein- protein Interactions (PPIs), including IID, iRefIndex, PINA, HINT, Mentha, SZDB and InWeb_IM; (vi) Protein 3D Structures, including PDB, MMDB and SCOP; (vii) Disease-associated information, including ClinVar, OMIM, GWASdb and GWAS CENTRAL; (viii) Drug-target Relations, including DrugBank, TTD, KPID, CARLSBAD, SuperTarget, GRAC and PDTD; (ix) Post-translational Modifications (PTMs), including CPLM, dbPAF, dbPPT, phosSNP, PhosphositePlus, Phospho.ELM, dbPTM, PHOSIDA, BioGRID, HPRD, UniProt, O-GlycBase, PhosphoBase and mUbiSiDa; (x) DNA Methylation, including MethyCancer, TCGA, ICGC and COSMIC; (xi) Protein Expression/Proteomics, including The Human Protein Atlas, Human Proteome Map and GPMDB. Compared with our previously developed UUCD 1.0 (~0.41 GB), iUUCD 2.0 has a size of ~32.1 GB of data with a &gt; 75-fold increase in data volume.

These data can be used to interpret and guide the analysis of results from new studies and develop new hypotheses. Here, we report the development of the Molecular Interaction Search Tool (MIST; http://fgrtools.hms.harvard.edu/MIST/). The MIST database integrates biological interaction data from yeast, nematode, fly, zebrafish, frog, rat and mouse model systems, as well as human. For individual or short gene lists, the MIST user interface can be used to identify interacting partners based on proteinâ€“protein and genetic interaction (GI) data from the species of interest as well as inferred interactions, known as interologs, and to view a corresponding network. The data, interologs and search tools at MIST are also useful for analyzing â€˜omics datasets. In addition to describing the integrated database, we also demonstrate how MIST can be used to identify an appropriate cut-off value that balances false positive and negative discovery, and present use-cases for additional types of analysis. Altogether, the MIST database and search tools support visualization and navigation of existing protein and GI data, as well as comparison of new and existing data.",,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1116

Furthermore, P. aeruginosa is a model organism for the study of biofilm formation, quorum sensing, and bioremediation processes, each of which are dependent on unique pathways and metabolites. The PAMDB is modelled on the Escherichia coli (ECMDB), yeast (YMDB) and human (HMDB) metabolome databases and contains >4370 metabolites and 938 pathways with links to over 1260 genes and proteins. The database information was compiled from electronic databases, journal articles and mass spectrometry (MS) metabolomic data obtained in our laboratories. For each metabolite entered, we provide detailed compound descriptions, names and synonyms, structural and physiochemical information, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and MS spectra, enzymes and pathway information, as well as gene and protein sequences. The database allows extensive searching via chemical names, structure and molecular weight, together with gene, protein and pathway relationships.

These functional associations are inferred via integrating various data types using a naive Bayesian algorithm and orthology based information transfer across different species. This approach provides high coverage of the included genomes as well as high quality of inferred interactions. In this update of FunCoup we introduce four new eukaryotic species: Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Bos taurus, Oryza sativa and open the database to the prokaryotic domain by including networks for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The latter allows us to also introduce a new class of functional association between genes - co-occurrence in the same operon. We also supplemented the existing classes of functional association: metabolic, signaling, complex and physical protein interaction with up-to-date information. In this release we switched to InParanoid v8 as the source of orthology and base for calculation of phylogenetic profiles. While populating all other evidence types with new data we introduce a new evidence type based on quantitative mass spectrometry data.

The hierarchical classification is: protein-species, family, clan, with an identifier at each level. The MEROPS website moved to the EMBL-EBI in 2017, requiring refactoring of the code-base and services provided. The interface to sequence searching has changed and the MEROPS protein sequence libraries can be searched at the EMBL-EBI with HMMER, FastA and BLASTP. Cross-references have been established between MEROPS and the PANTHER database at both the family and protein-species level, which will help to improve curation and coverage between the resources. Because of the increasing size of the MEROPS sequence collection, in future only sequences of characterized proteins, and from completely sequenced genomes of organisms of evolutionary, medical or commercial significance will be added. As an example, peptidase homologues in four proteomes from the Asgard superphylum of Archaea have been identified and compared to other archaean, bacterial and eukaryote proteomes. This has given insights into the origins and evolution of peptidase families, including an expansion in the number of proteasome components in Asgard archaeotes and as organisms increase in complexity.

Second, the same interface should serve carefully curated metadata that record the provenance of the data and justify its interpretation in biological terms.

A total of 950 962 circRNAs were identified in normal samples only, and 170 909 circRNAs were identified in both tumor and normal samples, which could be further used as non-tumor background. We constructed a cancer-specific circRNA database (CSCD, http://gb.whu.edu.cn/CSCD). To understand the functional effects of circRNAs, we predicted the microRNA response element sites and RNA binding protein sites for each circRNA. We further predicted potential open reading frames to highlight translatable circRNAs. To understand the association between the linear splicing and the back-splicing, we also predicted the splicing events in linear transcripts of each circRNA. As the first comprehensive cancer-specific circRNA database, we believe CSCD could significantly contribute to the research for the function and regulation of cancer-associated circRNAs.",,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx863

Large cohorts and bioinformatics skills are required to perform the same analysis as WTSI.

The overarching goal of these screens is to measure sensitivity of cell lines to chemical perturbations, correlate these measures to genomic features, and thereby develop novel predictors of drug response. However, leveraging these valuable data is challenging due to the lack of standards for annotating cell lines and chemical compounds, and quantifying drug response. Moreover, it has been recently shown that the complexity and complementarity of the experimental protocols used in the field result in high levels of technical and biological variation in the in vitro pharmacological profiles. There is therefore a need for new tools to facilitate rigorous comparison and integrative analysis of large-scale drug screening datasets. To address this issue, we have developed PharmacoDB (pharmacodb.pmgenomics.ca), a database integrating the largest cancer pharmacogenomic studies published to date.

Building on this expertise, Gramene currently hosts 93 plant reference genomesâ€”over 3.9 million genes in 122,947 families with orthologous and paralogous classifications (release #63, October 2020). The genes and trees provide a framework to transfer knowledge on genetic markers, QTLs of agronomic traits, and conserved gene function between species. The orthologous genes support propagation of gene function, anchors for synteny, and conservation of genomic location harboring agronomically important loci. Information on gene family expansions, as well as local duplications, may provide insights into adaptive responses within and between species. In addition to providing anchors for transferring genome function between species, the protein-level alignments can be used as tools to identify artifacts in the gene structural annotations. Accurate structural annotations are necessary for assessing gene function, and critical for the application and adoption of gene editing approaches, which combined with traditional breeding efforts, will be used to improve future germplasm improvement strategies. Grameneâ€™s pathway portalâ€”the Plant Reactomeâ€”portrays pathway networks using a combination of manual biocuration in rice (320 reference pathways) and orthology-based projections to 106 species. The Reactome platform facilitates comparison between reference and projected pathways, gene expression analyses, and overlays of geneâ€“gene interactions. Gramene integrates ontology-based protein structureâ€“function annotation; information on genetic, epigenetic, expression, and phenotypic diversity; and gene functional annotations extracted from plant-focused journals using the Domain Informational Vocabulary Extraction (DIVE) algorithm. In addition, we train plant researchers in biocuration of genes and pathways; host curated maize gene structures as tracks in the maize genome browser; and integrate curated rice genes and pathways in the Plant Reactome. Gramene is supported by NSF (IOS-1127112) and USDA-ARS (1907-21000-030-00D).",,"We are grateful to Grameneâ€™s users, researchers, and numerous collaborators for sharing datasets generated by their projects, and for providing valuable suggestions and feedback that have helped us to improve the overall quality of Gramene as a community resource.

In this database, we provide 3331426 of the best primer pairs for each gene, based on primer pair coverage, as well as 47760359 alternative gene-specific primer pairs, which can be conveniently batch downloaded. The specificity and efficiency was validated for qPCR primer pairs for 66 randomly selected genes, in six different organisms, through qPCR assays and gel electrophoresis.

Importantly, the availability of diverse immunopeptidomic datasets has resulted in an increasing need to standardize, store and exchange this type of data to enable better collaborations among researchers, to advance the field more efficiently and to establish quality measures required for the meaningful comparison of datasets. Here we present the SysteMHC Atlas (https://systemhcatlas.org), a public database that aims at collecting, organizing, sharing, visualizing and exploring immunopeptidomic data generated by MS. The Atlas includes raw mass spectrometer output files collected from several laboratories around the globe, a catalog of context-specific datasets of MHC class I and class II peptides, standardized MHC allele-specific peptide spectral libraries consisting of consensus spectra calculated from repeat measurements of the same peptide sequence, and links to other proteomics and immunology databases.

They are usually present in seeds and storage tissues, but are also expressed in the aerial part of plant upon insect attack. Their activity on gut proteases attenuates amino acid assimilation and slows the growth of feeding insects. Owing to the direct defensive properties of PIs, several transgenic plants have been produced expressing specific inhibitors and tested for enhanced resistance against phytophagous insects. Even if this approach revealed effective in many cases, it also gave the opportunity to demonstrate the capacity of some insects to overcome the effect of PI ingestion by up-regulating the synthesis of new proteases, insensitive to PIs. In this respect, structural studies on PIs and protease-PI complexes are needed to better understand the molecular mechanism of protease resistance and to put the basis for designing new PIs active toward insensitive proteases. Among plant PIs, inhibitors active toward the four mechanistic classes of proteases (serine-, cysteine-, aspartic- and metallo-proteases) have been described. The activity of PIs is due to their capacity to form stable complexes with target proteases, blocking, altering or preventing access to the enzyme active site. Plant PIs can also be catalogued in a number of families on the basis of their primary structure. Many of these families contain PIs specific for a single mechanistic class of proteases, but this does not seem to be a rule. PLANT-PIs is a database developed to facilitate retrieval of information on plant PIs and their genes. The need for a database comes from the large amount of sequences available and the increasing amount of data concerning the activity and structure of these molecules. The database correlates information contained in primary sequence databases (EMBL and SwissProt) to functional analysis of the proteins reported in literature. For each PI links to sequence databases are reported together with a summary of the functional properties of the molecule (and its mutants) as deduced from literature. Transgenic plants obtained transferring PI genes are also reported as deduced from literature. PLANT-PIs, as up-dated in July 2002, contains information for 495 inhibitors, plus several isoinhibitors, identified over 129 plant species.

PIR has provided many protein databases and analysis tools to the scientific community, including the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database (PSD) of functionally annotated protein sequences. Because the protein sequence database activities of PIR, Swiss-Prot, and TrEMBL are now combined to produce UniProt databases, the PIR-PSD is no longer being updated. Release 80.00 (31-Dec-2004), the final release for PIR-PSD, is available for ftp download and online searching at the PIR website. All PIR-PSD entries have been merged into the UniProt databases and PIR-PSD identifiers can be used to retrieve and track these sequences in either UniProtKB or UniParc. PIR contributes to the functional annotation of UniProtKB protein sequences. Major ongoing annotation efforts include curation of protein families in the PIRSF (SuperFamily) system, definition of classification-driven rules for the propagation of position-specific features, protein names, and GO terms to protein entries, as well as bibliographic attribution of experimental features. A new PIR resource iProLINK provides multiple annotated literature corpora to facilitate text mining research in the area of literature-based database curation, named entity recognition, and protein ontology development. PIR continues to enhance iProClass, an integrated database of protein family, function, and structure information and a hub for mapping and integrating protein data from multiple sources, and maintains PIR-NREF, a non-redundant reference database of protein sequences.
The PIR web site connects data mining and sequence analysis tools to underlying databases for information retrieval and knowledge discovery, with functionalities for interactive queries, combinations of sequence and annotation text searches, and sorting and visual exploration of search results. The FTP site provides free download for database releases.","Recent developments for the UniProt, PIRSF, iProClass, and PIR-NREF databases are described individually in this on-line Database Collection.",The PIR is supported by NIH grant U01-HG02712 and NSF grants DBI-0138188 and ITR-0205470.,"Wu, C.H., Yeh, L.S., Huang, H., Arminski, L., Castro-Alvear, J., Chen, Y., Hu, Z., Kourtesis, P., Ledley, R.S., Suzek, B.E., Vinayaka, C.R., Zhang, J. and Barker, W.C.

These models are designed to support both automated and manually curated annotation of genomes. TIGRFAMs contains models of full-length proteins as well as domains at the levels of superfamilies, subfamilies and equivalogs (which are sets of homologous proteins that are conserved with respect to function since their last common ancestor). TIGRFAMs models are allowed to be heirarchically nested to yield the maximum amount of information for the annotation process. TIGRFAMs are thus complementary to Pfam models which are designed to represent non-overlapping structural domains. The TIGRFAMs database is integrated with the prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline at TIGR and thus is being constantly updated with respect to new information on protein function, model scope and performance. TIGRFAMs currently contains over 1600 protein families, having doubled in size in two years. TIGRFAMs is available for searching or downloading at www.tigr.org/TIGRFAMs.","Since the TIGRFAMs database was first described in the January 2001 database issue of Nucleic Acids Research, the number of models in TIGRFAMs has doubled to over 1600. A large number of entries have been assigned specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms. TIGRFAMs links are now reported in the SwissProt database. TIGRFAMs has been incorporated into InterPro; InterPro entries based on or including TIGRFAMs entries show parent/child and contains/found in relationships with entries from Pfam, SMART, and other protein classification databases. Continued use of TIGRFAMs in microbial annotation at TIGR has provided steady feedback for improving the accuracy of existing models while new genomes and new functional characterizationns became available. TIGRFAMs models now hit nearly twenty per cent of the proteins of typical newly sequenced bacterial genomes. The equivalog subset can be expected to make about 400 high-confidence specific functional assignments for a typical new 4-megabase bacterial genome.",,,Protein sequence databases,Protein domain databases; protein classification,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks1234

Insights into the mechanisms of Wnt action have emerged from several systems: genetics in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans; biochemistry in cell culture and ectopic gene expression in Xenopus embryos. Many Wnt genes in the mouse have been mutated, leading to very specific developmental defects. As currently understood, Wnt proteins bind to receptors of the Frizzled family on the cell surface. Through several cytoplasmic relay components, the signal is transduced to beta-catenin, which then enters the nucleus and forms a complex with TCF to activate transcription of Wnt target genes.

These relationships are often revealed only after the availability of protein structures and their structural comparison. SUPFAM [1-3] is a database of potential superfamily relationships derived from identifying distant evolutionary relationships between protein sequence families (Pfam families) and structural families (SCOP) using a rigorous profile-profile comparison method, AlignHUSH [4]. The methodology exploits the evolutionary information inherent of SCOP classification to identify related Pfam families. The present SUPFAM database update (Release 6) has been derived using Pfam (version 27.0) [5] and SCOP database (version 1.75) [6]. Firstly each Pfam family profile is searched against the SCOP family profiles to identify possible evolutionary relationships using AlignHUSH. We identify 5017 Pfam families could be associated with SCOP superfamilies. Secondly, the remaining Pfam families are searched against a database of profiles of Pfam families, to identify Pfam families that could be indirectly related to a SCOP family. About 247 Pfam families were associated with other Pfam families mapped to SCOP superfamily. Thus in the present database, associations of 5295 Pfam families (out of 14831 ~ 36%) with a SCOP family are reported. SUPFAM database also consists of clusters wherein Pfam families which could not be mapped to any structural superfamilies, but are found to be related to one another and are clustered together to form ""Potentially New Superfamilies (PNSFs)"". These PNSFs (126 in number) could provide an important resource for structural genomics initiative targets.","The current update of SUPFAM uses functionally related families in Pfam (Version 27.0) and structural families of SCOP (1.75v). A rigorous profile-profile based comparison method (AlignHUSH) has been used for the generation of the database. In this update we have applied a meticulous decision tree with stringent Z-score and length coverage thresholds. The decision tree also extends to automatedly remove the ambiguous relationships. 5295 Pfam families are now mapped (directly or indirectly) to 1656 SCOP structural super-families. We have identified more than 250 additional relationships from the previous release. We provide the details of these evolutionary connections along with the Z-scores and also specifically report the non-obvious indirect relationships derived from Pfam family connections. For each SCOP superfamily in our database, we provide a graphical representation of the families within that superfamily and their related Pfam families. About 126 potentailly new functional superfamilies have been identified comprising of 572 Pfam families which could not be associated with any SCOP structural family using AlignHUSH. Details of 684 DUF/UPF connections to SCOP domain families and 131 DUF/UPF relationships with other Pfam families have also been provided.","This work is supported by Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi","1.

The SYSTERS protein sequence cluster set provides an automatically generated classification of all sequences of the SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL databases as well as of the predicted protein sequence sets of several completely sequenced organisms into disjoint protein family and superfamily clusters annotated with sequence information from various other resources. For each cluster an MView (database search or multiple alignment viewer) output is generated and from the resulting partial multiple alignment a majority consensus sequence is calculated. All consensus sequences together build a searchable sequence database. The sequences in every cluster have been multiply aligned and annotated with known domains from the Pfam protein family database.
GeneNest is a database and software package for producing and visualizing gene indices from ESTs and mRNAs. Currently, the database comprises gene indices of human (based on UniGene), mouse, A.thaliana, drosophila, and zebrafish. All sequences are preprocessed to detect, annotate and clip regions containing vector sequence, repeats or are of low quality. The subsequent assembly step is done with the Staden package. For all contigs of a cluster, consensus sequences are generated and extracted to build a searchable sequence database. The visualization of a contig provides further information about the sequences, the represented gene and open reading frames, and links to precomputed protein homologies detected in the SYSTERS database.
SpliceNest is a web based graphical tool to explore gene structure based on a mapping of the EST consensus sequences from GeneNest to a complete genome. Assuming that a cluster normally represents a single gene, every contig of a cluster is aligned separately to the corresponding genomic region, using a spliced alignment program.

GELBANK serves as a database for those proteomics labs that do not want to set up their own website for the presentation of their 2DE gel patterns and for those labs that would like to share their data with other researchers in the field. The most widely used separation method for proteome analysis is currently two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1), where the proteins are separated according to their isoelectric point (pI) in the first dimension and their molecular weight (MW) in the second dimension. Using protein specific dyes that are stoichiometric with respect to the optical density of the dye and the abundance of the protein, the relative abundance of each protein detected in a 2DE pattern can be determined (2, 3). Using calibration proteins, these 2DE gel patterns provide information of relative abundance, MW and pI of isolated proteins in the given pI and MW range. The stained protein spots can be analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting. GELBANK currently includes 90 completed genomes available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). A web interface allows the upload of 2 DE gel patterns and their annotation for registered users. The images are organized by species, tissue type, separation method, sample type, and staining method. The database can be queried based on these attributes. A web interface allows registered users to assign molecular weight and pH gradient profiles to their own 2DE gel patterns as well as link protein identifications to a given spot on the pattern. The website presents all of the submitted 2DE gel patterns where the end-user can dynamically display the images or parts of images along with both molecular weight and pH profile information and linked protein identification. A collection of images can be selected for the creation of animations where the user can select sub-regions of interest from an unlimited number of 2DE gel patterns for visualization. The website also presents simple search engines for the querying of proteomes based on annotation data, molecular weight, isoelectric point (pI), and sequence pattern. If the protein has been linked with a given 2DE gel pattern, a link to the associated pattern(s) is presented. Titration curves of a given sequence or a collection of sequences can be generated and a utility is provided that dynamically calculates the isoelectric point of a given protein sequence by 'turning' on and off those amino acids affecting it.

The D. melanogaster genomic data included in the last MitoDrome published version derived from a search of the Drosophila genomic, ESTs and cDNA sequences in the FlyBase database using as a probe the aminoacid sequences of the human mitochondrial proteins available in SWISSPROT database. On the basis of a computational comparative analysis, each D. melanogaster gene encoding a product sharing significant homology with a human mitochondrial protein was putatively classified as encoding a mitochondrion- targeted protein and annotated in the database.","The recent availability of the complete genomic sequences of D. pseudoobscura and A. gambiae has prompted us to extend our analysis to the identification and characterization at the genomic level of the nuclear OXPHOS genes of these two dipteran species, using the sequences of the D. melanogaster genes involved in oxidative phosphorilation as probes for a search of their genomes. The orthologs of 78 putative OXPHOS nuclear genes present in each of the three Dipterans have been identified and annotated, taking into account conservation in amino acid sequence, intron/exon structure, intron length, and presence of duplications in the genome. In addition, a total of 47 putative paralogs of these genes in the three dipteran species investigated have also been identified and annotated. The need to add new data to MitoDrome together with the higher level of efficiency required to manage data and offer the database users the best in terms of usability and interoperability have imposed a complete restructuring of the database, resulting in an expanded MitoDrome Database Version retrievable at the address http://www2.ba.itb.cnr.it/mitodrome/.
This new database version collects the results of the comparative analyses carried out on D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura and A. gambiae OXPHOS nuclear genes together with an accurate manual annotation of their genomic sequences, transcripts (RNA), and polypeptide products.
The main changes introduced with respect to the last published version of MitoDrome concern the database structure, its web interface and, obviously, its content. Indeed, apart from structural changes, the new version includes (1) a more comprehensive set of Dipteran sequences, (2) a Ã¢â‚¬Å“ClustersÃ¢â‚¬Â\x9D section where sets of putative orthologous and paralogous genes are grouped, (3) gene structure and protein sequences comparisons (4) data on P-insertion mutants of D. melanogaster OXPHOS nuclear genes. More details are provided in the on-line Ã¢â‚¬Å“ManualÃ¢â‚¬Â\x9D accessible by the new MitoDrome Home page.
Our future plans include both the extension of the analysis to the nuclear OXPHOS genes of other organisms and the identification and annotation of the D. pseudoobscura and A. gambiae orthologs and paralogs of the other D. melanogaster genes collected in the previous version of MitoDrome. When this last goal is reached, the previous version of the MitoDrome database will be eliminated as obsolete, its data having been completely integrated in the new version.","This work has been supported by 'Ministero dellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Istruzione, dellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢UniversitÀ e della RicercaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (MIUR), Italy, within the grants of PNR 2001-2003 (FIRB art.8) D.M. 199, Strategic Program: Post-genome, grant 31-063933 and Project n.2, Cluster C03 L. 488/929.","1.

To this aim, we have created three resources, ACTIVITY_Reports, ACTIVITY_Tuning, and TFsite_Annotations. For a given site with known sequence-activity relationships, the first database ACTIVITY_Reports accumulates the quantitative data on the impact of the site surrounding, which allows for correct recognition of this site. From this way characterized site-surrounding relationships, the Java applet aimed at precise analysis of phylogenetic footprints of only this known site is automatically generated and stored within the knowledge base ACTIVITY_Tuning. Next, the resulting database TFsite_Annotations documents the Java applet results obtained in the cases of only putative sites of the same type and the same location within the same regulatory region of the homologous gene. The resources enriching the current ACTIVITY release are available at URL=http://util.bionet.nsc.ru/databases/activity.html.","In our previous paper [Nucleic Acids Res, 29(1):284-287] we have developed the database ACTIVITY on DNA sequences with known quantitative activity rates and, thus, provided a hundred cross-tests between various sequence-activity relationships grouped by their protein-targets. All these cross-test results indicated that, for a given protein-binding site, the basic impact of the site core into sequence-activity relationships is invariant, whereas the modulating impact of the site surround is not. Since, with unpredictable surrounding-dependencies, it was not clear, what might be used for applying sequence-activity relationships in practice, the available components of our database ACTIVITY were slightly extended. To address this formidable challenge, our guesswork is that for two sites of the same type and at the same location within the same regions of homologous genes, surrounding-dependencies of sequence-activity relationships must be the most similar due to their common evolution origin. That is why the main idea of our recent developments was to precisely focus them on only the phylogenetic footprints of the protein-binding sites with known sequence-activity relationships. Therefore, in this work we have developed three resources, ACTIVITY_Reports, ACTIVITY_Tuning, and TFsite_Annotations. For a given site with known sequence-activity relationships, the first database ACTIVITY_Reports accumulates the quantitative data on the impact of the site surrounding, which allows for correct recognition of this site. From this way characterized site-surrounding relationship, the Java applet aimed at precise analysis of phylogenetic footprints of only this known site is automatically generated and stored within the next knowledge base ACTIVITY_Tuning.

At least monthly updates are scheduled for this new alignment, and similar alignments will be released for archaeal, eukaryotic, and mitochondrial small-subunit rRNA sequences. This new alignment can be displayed using either the taxonomy assigned by NCBI or in a schema closely matching the taxonomy proposed by Garrity et al. (3). Data subsets are available for sequences of length 1200 or greater and for sequences from type material. Annotation goals include up-to-date name, strain and culture deposit information, sequence length and quality information, references, and, in collaboration with Bergey's Trust (3), type status. In order to provide a phylogenetic context for the data, RDP-II makes available over 100 trees that span the phylogenetic breadth of life. Web based research tools are provided for comparing user submitted sequences to the RDP-II database (Sequence Match), aligning user sequences against the nearest RDP sequence (Sequence Aligner), examining probe and primer specificity (Probe Match), testing for chimeric sequences (Chimera Check), generating a distance matrix (Similarity Matrix), analyzing T-RFLP data (T-RFLP and TAP-TRFLP), a java-based phylogenetic tree browser (Sub Trees), a sequence search and selection tool (Hierarchy Browser) and a phylogenetic tree building and visualization tool (Phylip Interface). The latter tool has been enhanced to allow a choice of either the Phylip neighbor-joining (4) or Weighbor weighted neighbor-joining (5) programs for tree construction. In addition, the web-site includes an interactive tutorial to guide users through the basics of rRNA sequence analysis. This tutorial is suitable both for the researcher new to rRNA based phylogenetic analysis and as a teaching module for upper-level undergraduate and graduate classes. The RDP-II email address for questions or comments is rdpstaff@msu.edu","New to RDP-II this year are enhancements to allow tree-building using the Weighbor method, in addition to neighbor-joining, and a new (eu)bacterial alignment of over 50,000 rRNA sequences that is updated on a regular basis.The RDP (eu)bacterial alignment is updated monthly and now contains over 76,000 sequences.","We thank several individuals for their past contributions: Robin Gutell (and his colleagues), Bonnie Maidak, Tim Lilburn, Niels Larson, Tom Macke, Michael J.

SELEXdb,https://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/summary/246,http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/systems/selex/,,,jpon@bionet.nsc.ru,"SELEX_DB is an online resource containing both the experimental data on in vitro selected DNA/RNA oligomers (aptamers) and the applets for these oligomers recognition. In vitro selection of oligomers binding target proteins is a novel technology intensively being developed during the last decade, for sieving a pool of synthetic oligomers through repeated cycles of PCR-amplification and protein-binding selection (1). According to Human Genome Annotation, we have developed the SELEX_DB database on oligomers selected in vitro, the database being supplied by Web-available applets for site recognition (2). Besides, since many disease may be caused not only by the mutation-altered transcription factor binding true-site on DNA, but also by the appearance of a novel protein-fitting noise-site altering a normal regulation of a gene network (e.g., the substitution -376G>A in human TNF gene promoter produces the transcription factor OCT-fitting noise-site causing the clinical phenotype 'severe malaria' (3)), the in vitro selected aptamers are very informative for the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis. At the same time, in prokaryota, the discrepancies between in vitro selected and natural sites by nucleotide-position frequency matrices have been comprehensively demonstrated (4). Besides, the positional Information Content matrices of the in vitro selected aptamers was found to be correlating with the protein-binding strength magnitudes, whereas neither correlation was found for the corresponding natural site (5). This means that, in prokaryota, natural sites were selected in vivo according to their biological activity, but not by protein affinity. In eukaryota, the relationship between in vivo and in vitro selections seems to be very knotty. From one hand, the in vitro selected TBP-binding DNAs provide the natural TATA-box activity (6). Moreover, homologous c-Myb and v-Myb proteins, minimal Myb/DNA-binding domain and, Myb-fortified cell nuclear extract are selecting in vitro the aptamers, similarities of which to one the others and to the natural c-Myb sites are significant (7). From the other hand, in vitro selected YY1-binding DNAs, inserted into the plasmids and transfected into various cells ('plasmid+cell' system), repress the reported gene (8), thus supporting the fact that YY1 binding strength and repression magnitudes do not correlate. Moreover, for these in vitro selected YY1-fitting aptamers, these YY1-caused repression measured in vivo at one 'plasmid+cell' system do not correlate to the proper magnitudes detected in vivo at the other 'plasmid+cell' system. According to this evident system-dependence of both in vitro and in vivo selected experimental data, nowadays a fundamental question is how in vitro selected data could be implemented for natural gene analysis (1). That is why novel release of the SELEX_DB has been supported by two databases SYSTEM (9, 10) and CROSS_TEST, storing both experiment systems and their cross-validation tests. By cross-validation testing, we have unexpectedly observed that, for a fixed protein-binding site, the recognition accuracy increases with the growth of homology between the target and test proteins. For natural sites, the recognition accuracy was less than for the nearest protein homologs and higher than for the distant homologs and non-homologous proteins binding the common site. The current SELEX_DB release is available at URL=http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/systems/selex/.","Since many recent experiments have clearly demonstrated that comparability between in vivo and in vitro measurement systems is still very complex and complicated, we have supplemented SELEX_DB by two novel complementary 'experiment<=>regularity' databases. At first, the novel database SYSTEM is storing descriptions of experiments (9, 10). The SYSTEM entry cites the author's aims of an experiment and conclusions, experimental details, selection techniques, etc. Since in vitro design is capable only to simplify the real in vivo situation, SYSTEM gives information on the limits of in vitro selected data interpretation, regularities revealed, which could be applicable to analysis of gene structure, function, regulation and expression. That is why the second novel database has been required to consolidate the all experimental data obtained at various measurement systems referring to a given protein-binding site. Thus, the supplementary CROSS_TEST database documents cross-validation test results of the ¡§C¡¨-encoded applet exploiting in vitro selected data, represented in nucleotide-position frequency matrix form, in order to discriminate the related natural sites or some other selected in vitro oligomers out of random polynucleotide sequences. Currently, it contains over hundred cross-tests. For each pair, ¡§in vitro trained¡¨ applet plus the tested independent data set, the means and standard deviation of the site recognition score are given, as well as false positive and negative errors, chi-square statistic value, and its confidence level Ã†â€™Ñ. The statistical estimates are hyperlinked to the training and testing data entries of our database SAMPLES (10, 11) and to the current release of SELEX_DB. Thus, CROSS_TEST answers the fundamental question how and at what accuracy and significance in vitro selected oligomers stored in SELEX_DB correspond to various related natural sites and other in vitro selected oligomers. Implementation of our cross-validation tests demonstrates that in eukaryotes in vitro selected set of sites is more similar to the natural site set than to the other in vitro selected set of sequences of homologous or other related proteins. These eukaryotes-based results contradict to conclusion in (5) stating that in vitro selection in prokaryotes do not always mimic natural evolution. This may reflect different evolutionary strategies of in vivo selection: in prokaryotes, selection is mainly directed to biological activity of individual DNA-protein complex (4, 5), whereas in eukaryotes it is realized via multi-component transcriptional machinery, which is selected by both individual DNA-protein affinity and integral characteristics of protein-protein complexes. These observations could be useful for application of in vitro selected data for genome annotation in eukaryotes.",The work is supported by the grant RFBR-01-04-49860 (Russia).,"1.

Astral augments SCOP, a manual classification of protein domains according to structure, by providing a library of sequences which each corresponds to a structural domain classified in SCOP. To do so, the PDB entry for each SCOP domain is examined, and a mapping is constructed between the SEQRES information (that reflects the molecule studied) and the ATOM records (atoms observed experimentally) Because the majority of the structures in PDB are very similar to others, it is frequently helpful to reduce the redundancy by selecting high-quality representative subsets. To do this, we compare all extracted sequences using standard sequence comparison algorithms. This information is then combined with a quality score that provides a first order estimate of the resolution and regularity of crystallographically determined protein structures. We are thus able to provide sequence subsets with both limited redundancy and high quality structural information. The level of redundancy in these subsets is user defined, and is based on one of three criteria: percent sequence identity, BLAST E-value, or SCOP similarity. These sequence subsets are an ideal starting point for homology based structure prediction, and have also proven useful for testing new sequence comparison methods, and structure analysis. Several major improvements have been made to the ASTRAL compendium since its initial release two years ago. The number of protein domains included has doubled from 15,190 to 30,867, and additional databases have been added. The Rapid Access Format (RAF) database contains manually curated mappings linking the amino acid sequences of proteins in the PDB (SEQRES records in the database entry) to the atoms experimentally observed (ATOM records), in a format designed for rapid access by automated tools. This information is used to derive sequences for protein domains in the SCOP database. In cases where a SCOP domain spans several protein chains, all of which can be traced back to a single genetic source, a genetic domain sequence is created by concatenating the sequences of each chain in the order found in the original gene sequence. Both the standard library of SCOP sequences and a library including genetic domain sequences are available. Selected representative subsets derived from both libraries using the criteria described above are also included.","Manually curated, Rapid Access Format sequence maps Genetic Domain sequences Translation table for chemically modified amino acids",This project is funded by NIH grant 1 P50 GM62412.

Each structural family is expanded with domain sequence relatives recruited from GenBank using a variety of efficient sequence search protocols and reliable thresholds. This extended resource, known as the CATH protein family database (CATH-PFDB) contains a total of 310,000 domain sequences classified into 26,812 sequence families. New sequence search protocols have been designed, based on these intermediate sequence libraries, to allow more regular updating of the classification. Further developments include the adaptation of a recently developed method for rapid structure comparison (GRATH,(1)), based on secondary structure matching, for domain boundary assignment (CATHEDRAL,(2)). The philosophy behind CATHEDRAL is the recognition of recurrent folds already classified in CATH. Benchmarking of CATHEDRAL, using manually validated domain assignments, demonstrated that 43% of domains boundaries could be completely automatically assigned. This is an improvement on a previous consensus approach for which only 10-20% of domains could be reliably processed in a completely automated fashion. Since domain boundary assignment is a significant bottleneck in the classification of new structures, CATHEDRAL will also help to increase the frequency of CATH updates.",,,"1.

It provides access to all structure entries deposited at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Nucleic Acid Database (NDB). In addition, basic information on the architecture of biological macromolecules and brief descriptions of experimental methods in structure determination are offered. By combining automatic and manual processing it is possible both to keep pace with the rapidly growing number of known biopolymer structures and to provide information not available from automatic procedures at least for selected entries. A variety of visualization and analysis tools for complete molecules as well as for parts of molecules, such as hetero components, sites and cis-peptide bonds, are available for each entry. The database can be accessed either by search options or by browsing precomputed or dynamically generated entry tables. In addition to the search for PDB or NDB codes and a full-text search of the structure file header, searching for entry names/accession numbers, species names, gene names and entry descriptions from SWISS-PROT and also for NCBI species names, Pfam family names and SMART domain names is possible. With the increasing number of structures the generation of classification schemes and of relationships between different entries becomes more and more important. Among other tools the built-in hetero components and site databases help to accomplish this aim. A PDB/SWISS-PROT cross reference scheme takes into account cross reference information provided by both the PDB and SWISS-PROT. By means of this scheme PDB structure tables listed by SWISS-PROT protein or species names can be generated. A genus/species classification provides compilations of structure entries for species listed by frequency of occurrence in the PDB or by the deposition data of the very first structure for a particular species (PDB Structure Species Timeline). A helix and bending analysis tool provides consistent information on all DNA and RNA structures with at least 6 successive base pairs. These data are used for a comprehensive bending classification of nucleic acid structures. Finally, a steadily increasing number of links to other databases helps to provide as much useful information as possible in one place.","The IMB Jena Image Library now offers substantially extended search options. In addition to the old search for PDB or NDB codes and a full-text search of the structure file header they allow to search for entry names/accession numbers, species names, gene names and entry descriptions from SWISS-PROT, but also for NCBI species names, Pfam family names and SMART domain names. A new genus/species classification provides PDB structures genus or species tables listed by genus/species name, number of structures known for a genus/species and deposition data for the very first structure of a particular genus/species (timeline).

Protein domain decomposition as proposed by SCOP (Version 1.75C) is used in the PALI database (version 2.8c) [3]. Non-redundant entries with best resolution corresponding to each SCOP domain family are used for the structural alignments.","There are 2220 multi-member families and 1582 orphans (single-member families) consisting of about 20,000 domains in the current version of PALI. Over 200,000 pair-wise and 2220 multiple structural alignments have been generated for all multimember families. Every family with at least three members is associated with two dendrograms, one based on the structural dissimilarity metric (SDM) defined for every pair-wise superposition and the other based on the identity of the topologically equivalent residues. For orphan families, the domain level sequences are provided. Alignments of protein domains of known 3-D structure from PALI integrated with homologous sequences from UniProt (Universal Protein Resource) database [4,5] are also available for every family in PALI. PSI-BLAST search using a query sequence can be performed against the structural members in PALI, the structural members integrated with the sequence homologues from UniProt database (PALI+). All the pair-wise structural superposition were generated using DALI [6,7] program. Structure alignment program MUSTANG [8] was used to superimpose multiple homologous protein domain structures. A graphical interface (Jmol applet) for every family in PALI to view the structure based multiple alignment and pair-wise structural alignments is also provided. Integration of the domain sequences with UniProt database is achieved in the following two steps: Structure based multiple sequence alignments for each family are queried against Uniref90 using PSI-BLAST for 20 iterations and the hits obtained are filtered subsequently based on 70% query coverage and E-value of 0.0001. HMM profiles for each family are generated based on structure based multiple sequence alignment using hmmbuild (HMMER 3.0) [9]. These profiles are used to obtain integrated sequence-structure alignments at the family level using hmmalign (HMMER 3.0). For orphan PALI families subsequent to PSI-BLAST runs the sequences are aligned using MAFFT [10]. 
In the current version (v2.8c), we have added ~300 new multi-membered families and 148 new orphan families to the previous version. These correspond to ~2500 new domains added to the multiple and pairwise structural alignments.

Criteria used to select representatives are: a) quality of atomic co-ordinate data, b) sequence uniqueness, and c) conformation uniqueness. The system of PDB-REPRDB (2,3) is designed so that the user may obtain a quick selection of representative chains from PDB. System operation can be divided into two stages: 1) calculation of similarities between all pairs of protein chains, 2) classification of those chains and selection of representative chains according to priorities specified by the user. Similarities are calculated beforehand, and selection of representative chains can be dynamically configured according to the user's requirement. The WWW interface provides a large degree of freedom in setting parameters, such as cut-off scores of sequence and structural similarity. Users can eliminate unnecessary chains from the PDB chain list by setting threshold values and can also change priority of nine factors: resolution, R-factor, number of chain breaks, ratio of non-standard amino acid residues, ratio of residues with only Ca co-ordinates, ratio of residues with only backbone co-ordinates, number of residues, whether mutant or wild, and whether complex or not. Moreover, users can select whether or not to include entries by NMR experimental techniques and whether or not to include membrane protein chains by setting a flag of NMR and membrane, respectively. The membrane flag was introduced into the system in September 2002. One can obtain a representative list and classification data of protein chains from the system. The representative list includes information about factors mentioned above, EC number, and compound in PDB. The 'eID' sections are hyper-linked to data on classified groups, and a graphic representation of three-dimensional structure can be displayed using the RasMol program by clicking on 'e'. Furthermore, 'eEcnumber' sections are hyper-linked to the Ligand chemical database for enzyme reactions (LIGAND) (4). The system is available at the new PDB-REPRDB WWW server (http://www.cbrc.jp/pdbreprdb/).","In recent years, the number of entries including membrane protein structures in the PDB has increased rapidly with the determination of numbers of membrane protein structures because of improved X-ray crystallography, NMR, and electronic microscope experimental techniques. Since protein structure researchers deal separately with globular proteins and membrane proteins, membrane proteins should be separate from globular proteins. One recent improvement is the introduction of a new factor of elimination, which does not include membrane protein chains, for selecting representatives on the top page of the present PDB-REPRDB. The membrane protein chain, including a domain defined by the SCOP (5), is eliminated by this factor. Moreover, the PDB-REPRDB for membrane protein chains, which selects representatives from membrane protein chains including a membrane domain defined by the SCOP, has been developed for researchers for membrane proteins. The PDB-REPRDB system for membrane protein chains is available at the same site. The current database of PDB-REPRDB includes 39,045 protein chains from 18,925 PDB entries (25 May, 2003), and for the membrane includes 684 protein chains, which include membrane domains in SCOP database of release 1.63 (20 May 2003).

SCOP embodies an evolutionary classification produced by human experts. This allows us to use a theory of protein evolution that encompasses our knowledge of the great variety, and the full extent, of the different types of changes that take place during evolution. So far, automatic procedures for classification can measure only a few of these types of changes and not the full extent of them, this makes them less powerful or less accurate. SCOP extends the ability of humans to analyse and interpret the data and makes the invaluable knowledge of protein evolutionary repertoire broadly available to scientific researchers.
The fundamental unit of classification in the SCOP database is the protein domain. A domain is defined as an evolutionary unit observed in nature either in isolation or in more than one context in multidomain proteins. The protein domains are classified hierarchically into families, superfamilies, folds and classes, whose meaning has been discussed before [1]. The first official SCOP release nine years ago comprised 3179 protein domains grouped into 498 families, 366 superfamilies and 279 folds [1]. The seven main classes in the latest release (1.65) contain 40452 domains organised into 2327 families, 1294 superfamilies and 800 folds. These domains correspond to 20619 entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [4] and one literature reference to a structure with unpublished coordinates. Statistics of the current and previous releases, summaries and full histories of changes and other information are available from the SCOP website (http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/) together with parseable files encoding all SCOP data [2].

For each structure information is available concerning the glycan type, linkage and anomeric configuration, mass and composition. Detailed information is provided on native and recombinant sources, including species, tissue and/or cell type, cell line, strain, blood group and disease state. There are over 1000 different biological sources represented in GlycoSuiteDB, from over 200 different tissue or cell types. Where known, the proteins to which the glycan structures are attached are described, and cross- references to SWISS-PROT are given if applicable. The database annotations include literature references which are linked to PubMed. Detailed information on the methods used to determine each glycan structure are provided to help the user assess the quality of the structural assignment. The web site (http://www.glycosuite.com) allows the user to search the database using a combination of 2-D glycan structure, composition, glycan linkage type, reducing-terminal sugar residue, glycan mass (monoisotopic or average), species, biological system, tissue or cell type, disease state, protein name, SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL accession number, or reference information. Results can be sorted by glycan mass, protein name, tissue or cell type, disease state or taxonomy. The emphasis of this database is to be consistent. This will enable reliable mining of the information for future applications of glycobiology.","An exciting new feature has been added to GlycoSuiteDB. We have now enabled searching by 2-D glycan structure. The user may construct a 2-D structure, or partial structure, via a simple point and click interface. Using a novel search method, this user-defined structure is matched with any part of a glycan structure in GlycoSuiteDB. This new search facility enables the user to rapidly and correctly identify glycan structures containing significant branching and specific epitopes that may be of biological importance. This 2-D glycan structure query may also be combined with any of the existing query types in an advanced query.",,"1. Cooper, C.A., Harrison, M.J., Wilkins, M.R., and Packer, N.H. (2001).

One section catalogues the current literature on imprinted genes in humans and animals. The second, and new, section catalogues current reports of parental origin of de novo mutations in humans alone. The database includes descriptions of 85 imprinted genes from several mammalian species, over 300 entries on reported parent-of-origin effects in animals, and 1700 mutations (found in 59 different genes) with a parent-of-origin effect. Data is accessed through a search engine and references are hyperlinked to PubMed, UCSC Genome Browser and Ensembl.","We have recently added a comprehensive section on spontaneous mutations that show a bias with respect to their parental origin. This new part of the database can be searched according to mutation type, disorder, chromosomal location, gene name, and inheritance pattern. Outcomes of the search are presented in a tabular format with the following information: disorder, inheritance pattern, incidence of disorder, gene name, chromosomal location, evidence of a paternal or maternal age effect, mutation type and any recurrent mutations associated with a parent-of-origin effect, number of paternal mutations, number of maternal mutations, and PubMed reference. Data for base substitutions are separated according to the type of base substitution (missense mutation, nonsense mutation or splice site mutation), whether the mutation is a transition or transversion mutation, and whether the base substitution falls within a CpG dinucleotide. The distinction is made between large deletions and insertions (>20 base pairs) and small deletions and insertions (< 20 base pairs). This size distinction is made based upon the possibility of different mechanisms contributing to these different types of mutations, and therefore potentially different parental origins.",Sue Harvey provides ongoing support and manages the database.,"1.

MPDB includes information on synthetic oligos that can either be used as probes or as primers. Information was derived from scientific literature. Only oligonucleotides of length lesser than 100 bp were considered. More than 4000 entries are stored in MPDB. Oligonucleotides are described on the basis of: name, oligo type (primer, probe, antisense), nucleotidic sequence, amino acid sequence (if part of a coding region), target gene and related infos (localization within the gene and recognized variants or specificities), applications, methods, technical notes, complementary primer (if used for PCR), primers for amplification (if probe), bibliographic references. Integration with other molecular biology databases is ensured with links to: i) EMBL Data Library, through the Target Gene accession number, ii) PubMed, through the PubMed PMID identifier, iii) HSAGENES database, through the HUGO code of the target gene. Further links are being implemented including those to GDB and GeneCard. MPDB contents are particularly adequate for the setting up of internal links, links that connect two different entries of the same database: pair of primers are used for PCR methods, probes can be a result of a PCR amplification and pairs of primers can be used to amplify a probe. The following links were defined: i) between primers conjunctly used for PCR, ii) between a primer and the probes that it can amply, iii) between a probe and the primers that can be used for its amplification. These links have been actually set up in MPDB. Through an SRS search, it is possible to search for a specific probe and retrieve the information about the primers that are needed for its amplification. This can either be done by performing an SRS link operation or by using the HTML links that are included in the display of the results. MPDB is currently managed by using MySQL, an 'open source' relational database, while searches are only allowed through implementations of the SRS integration software. MPDB data structure includes few free texts: the majority of the information is encoded and managed through controlled vocabularies. Information is often represented with one of a few items taken from the vocabularies. This is true for the applications and the methods where the SRS index includes the entire expressions that define items of the controlled vocabulary. E.g., 'apolipoprotein deficit' is not indexed by using the keys 'apolipoprotein' and 'deficit', but under the unique key 'apolipoprotein deficit'. MPDB is currently available for searching through SRS implementations at IRCCS AOU San Martino IST, Genoa, IT, http://bioinformatics.hsanmartino.it/mpdb/ . It is referenced as MOLPROBE. MPDB can easily be implemented in every SRS site: the data file and the related syntax files are available from the SRS implementation or on request from the contact person.

Scaffold/matrix attached regions (S/MARs) are DNA sequences that mediate the tight contact of the chromatin with the proteinaceous scaffold within the nucleus. They have shown to be necessary for chromatin loops to form [3] and they were observed at the base of chromatin loops [4]. S/MARs have also been assigned to function in gene expression. Recently it has been shown that S/MARs can serve as landing platforms for several chromatin remodeling factors and thereby influence gene expression [5]. S/MARs were also attributed a fundamental role in carcinogenesis [6].

The Browserâ€™s Web-based tools â€“ including BLAT, the Table Browser, VisiGene, the Gene Sorter, Genome Graphs, and the Variant Annotation Integrator -- provide an integrated environment for visualizing, comparing, analyzing, and sharing both publicly available and user-generated genomic data sets. As of September 2016, the database contained genomic sequence and a basic set of annotation â€˜tracksâ€™ for 96 unique species, many with multiple assembly versions. Most genome assemblies offer mapping and sequence annotation tracks describing assembly, gap, and GC content, and alignments of mRNA, EST, and RefSeq data from GenBank. Some assemblies provide additional gene annotations and sequence alignments of selected species to facilitate comparative and evolutionary investigations. The heavily annotated human genome offers extensive conservation and evolutionary comparisons, a large collection of gene models, regulation, expression, epigenetics and tissue differentiation, variation, phenotype and disease association data, and text-mined data from publications. In addition to the native data sets local to the UCSC servers, the Genome Browser offers several options to users for viewing their own sequence and annotations: track and assembly data hubs, custom tracks, and sessions. The Genome Browser database and tools may also be installed on a local server for customized use. The full set of data, software tools, downloads, and documentation can be found on the Genome Browser website.","During the 2015-16 timeframe, three new species assemblies were added (brown kiwi, aptMan1; crab-eating macaque, macFas5; Malayan flying lemur, galVar1) and new assembly versions were added for the following eight species: C. elegans (ce11), cat (felCat8), chicken (galGal5), gray mouse lemur (micMur2), platypus (ornAna2), rhesus macaque monkey (rheMac8), western clawed frog (xenTro7), and western gorilla (gorGor4). Support for new data types include CRAM, RNA-Seq expression data, and long-range chromatin interaction pairs. The GENCODE Genes set is now the default gene set for the latest GRCh38/hg38 human assembly, replacing the previous default set, UCSC Genes. Updated UCSC Genes tracks are available for human and mouse. A new 100-vertebrate conservation track was released on the hg38 human assembly that compares pairwise alignments for 100 species from a variety of clades. The C. elegans (ce11) 26-species conservation track was added, which shows the multiple alignments and measurements of evolutionary conservation for 26 nematode species. New user-interface changes include newly designed home and gateway pages as well as a new â€œmulti-regionâ€\x9D track display configuration for exon-only, gene-only, and custom regions visualization. The ability to make sessions public or add sessions to a new ""public sessions gallery"" was added. To assist users who are geographically closer to Asia, this year's changes include the unveiling of a new supported mirror site in Japan. Thirteen public hubs were also added.","Sincere gratitude is extended to the worldwide users of the UCSC Genome Browser, from college students who are just beginning their journey to experienced researchers. Special appreciation is extended to funders, collaborators, and contributors who give value beyond measure to the research possibilities within the browser. Much thanks is given to the exceptional group of system administrators, the management team, and all staff who support the UCSC Genome Browser.","1.

UniSTS is tightly integrated with the NCBI Map Viewer displays of STS maps. In addition, STSs are regularly incorporated from other databases, including dbSTS, RHdb, and several model organism databases. When the genomic sequence becomes available for an organism, it is of interest to find the positions of all the mapped STSs within the sequence, both to validate the assembly and to integrate STS maps that may not have shared many common markers.

The goals of the project are as follows:
-to create a tissue expression profile for each human gene
-to learn about the function of unknown genes from the similarities in their expression profiles to those of known genes
-to create tissue specificity scores for each gene.
GeneNote currently provides expression tissue vectors for each GeneCards (http://www.genecards.org) gene for the following tissues: bone marrow, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, skeletal muscle, spinal cord, spleen, and thymus, all color-coded into the immune, nervous, muscle and secretory system groups. Two replicates are provided for each tissue.
To reflect a quality measure, variation plots are also presented, which visualize Pearson's correlations between individual probe-set tissue vectors and the average tissue vector for each gene, as well as relative scalar lengths of individual vectors. In addition to experimental results, in silico gene expression was calculated for GeneCards by mining the Unigene database for information about the number of unique clones per gene per tissue, and the data presented on a root scale designed to be visually parallel with the experimental tissue vectors.
Expanding beyond the GeneCards gene-centric view, the GeneNote web site provides additional detailed information on a probe-set basis including links to GeneAnnot (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneannot), and will offer a variety of specialized searching and clustering options.

The sensitivity score measures how many probes in a probe-set connect to a particular gene;
specificity measures how many other genes match a probe-set, and with how many probes.

The resource aims to provide intuitive access to data generated by the WTSI Pathogen Sequencing Unit (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Pathogens/) and its collaborators. Over the past year, the number and range of organisms in GeneDB has continued to increase, now totalling 33 datasets, including representatives from two new taxa - viruses and parasitic helminths. In addition, GeneDB is designed to store data from both initial shotgun projects with automated annotation through to completed genomes. Four of the organism datasets, (S. pombe, P. falciparum, T. brucei and L. major), are being actively curated with weekly updates to sequence and annotation.
As many of the datasets in GeneDB are from organisms that cause devastating diseases in the developing world, a stand alone version of GeneDB has been produced for CD distribution of a sub-set of the data. The CD supports all the core searching and display functions of the site and is particularly aimed at increasing access for researchers in endemic countries. (A Tri-tryp CD is freely available via http://www.who.int/tdr/media/multimedia/trypanosomatids.htm ).","Recent developments have concentrated on both extending the curated information captured and cross-linked on the feature pages, and the addition of new tools for data retrieval, browsing and searching.

At its core are the three tables FACTOR, SITE, and GENE. A link between FACTOR and SITE indicates the interaction (binding) between them. Experimental evidence for this interaction is given in the SITE entry in form of the method (gel shift, footprinting analysis, ...) which was used to show the binding and the cell from which the factor was derived (factor source). On the basis of those, method and cell, a quality value is given to describe the ""confidence"" with which a binding activity could be assigned to a specific factor. When a number of binding sites have been collected for a factor, the site sequences are aligned and nucleotide distribution matrices are derived (MATRIX). These matrices are used by the tool Match™ to find potential binding sites in uncharacterized sequences, while Patch™, another tool, uses the single sites (and IUPAC consensus sequences), which are stored in the SITE table. A new, third tool, P-Match™ combines now the strengths of the matrix-based and the pattern-based approaches. While the binding sites are grouped into matrices to find a common denominator for the binding specificity of a certain factor, the transcription factors themselves are classified according to their DNA-binding domains in the CLASS table, as well as in a hierarchical factor classification tree. In addition to the binding properties of the transcription factors lots of information on their structure, function and tissue specificity is collected. In the GENE entries the respective sites and their binding factors, as well as the composite elements from TRANSCompel®, are summarized. As some of the regulated genes encode transcription factors themselves, there are not only links from factors via sites to target genes, but also from genes to encoded factors and vice versa. Based on these links ""gene regulatory networks"" can be retrieved/constructed. The GENE table does not only connect information of TRANSFAC® and TRANSCompel®, but also of other of our databases like HumanPSD™, S/MARtDB™, or TRANSPATH®, a database on signaling networks, into which the factor-site-gene interactions of TRANSFAC® are fully integrated. And finally, the GENE entries serve as major linking source to a growing number of (other) external databases. Public versions of TRANSFAC® and the above mentioned programs are freely accessible for research groups from non-profit organizations at http://www.gene-regulation.com. The professional version of TRANSFAC®, which contains not only a larger data amount but also an extended functionality, including integrated versions of Match® and Patch® as well as a tool for visualization of gene regulatory networks, is available at http://www.biobase-international.com.","The number of linked databases has been extended. GENE entries include now, among among others, links to ENSEMBL, UniGene, EntrezGene, the proteome database HumanPSD™, and the promoter database TRANSPRO®. In addition, standard gene names from HGNC, MGI, and RGD, are included for human, mouse, and rat genes, respectively, as well as standard ORF names for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. With the help of InterProScan, Pfam, Smart and PROSITE domains have been assigned to the the protein sequences of the transcription factors. In respect of data growth, besides a general data increase (mostly for vertebrates), the gain of Drosophila transcription factor binding sites (by courtesy of the Drosophila DNase I footprint database) and of Arabidopsis factors (by courtesy of DATF, Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors) has to be stressed.","We thank Prof. Jingchu Luo, Dr. Anyuan Guo, and colleagues from Peking University, Center for Bioinformatics, for providing the DATF data and Dr. Casey Bergman and colleagues from University of Cambridge (U.K.), Department of Genetics, for the Drosophila footprint data.

²Department of Bioinformatics, UKG, University of GÖttingen, Goldschmidtstrasse 1, D-37077 GÖttingen, Germany",mkl@biobase.de,"TRANSPATH® is a database on signal transduction pathways that are modeled as bipartite graphs with molecules and reactions as node classes [1,2,3,4,5]. The molecule entries include polypeptides, modified forms, multicomponent complexes, high-order abstractions like families of proteins as well as other molecules such as Ca²⁺, NO, ATP, H₂O. Reaction entries connect molecules, give information on the interaction mechanism and effects and constitute chains and pathways. Individual reactions or chains of subsequent reactions define a direction of signal flow [6]. The integration with TRANSFAC®, a database on transcription factors and their DNA binding sites [7], provides the possibility to present the complete signaling pathways, from extracellular ligands through adaptors and kinase cascades to transcription factors and their target genes. In many cases the protein products of target genes are themselves involved in signal transduction events. Data have been manually extracted from peer-reviewed literature and are curated by experts. The reliability of interaction data in terms of the biological relevance is evaluated and a respective quality value is assigned. Cross-references to important sequence and signature databases such as EMBL/GenBank, UniProt/Swiss-Prot, InterPro, or Ensembl, EntrezGene, RefSeq are provided. The database is equipped with the tools for data visualisation and analysis [1,2,4,5]. The PathwayBuilder™ tool offers four different modes of network visualisation.","The molecule and reaction entries are hierarchically structured. Molecular components are present in several orthogonal hierarchies: according to species information, according to the modification status and organization in the complexes, and according to their function in the signaling flow. Reactions are described at three levels, molecular evidence, pathway steps and semantic. Individual signaling reactions with all mechanistic details available in the corresponding publication are stored at the molecular evidence level. The pathway steps have been presented in a form optimal for constructing the whole pathways; they are abstracted from species (within the mammalian or vertebrate taxon) still providing the mechanistic details. On the semantic level only those molecules are displayed that process and forward the signal. The current public release, TRANSPATH® 6.0, includes 20,155 molecules, 7,603 genes, 28,126 reactions. The professional releases of TRANSPATH®, equipped by the ArrayAnalyzer™ tool [2,5], are available at Biobase GmbH (www.biobase-international.com; info@biobase.de). The ArrayAnalyzer™ tool has been developed for the analysis of expression data. It serves to identify (potential) key nodes in the networks as well as to classify gene/protein lists according to TRANSPATH® pathways, GO terms, expression data, disease links.","Parts of the work were funded by grants of the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) ""Intergenomics"" (031U210B), collectively by BioRegioN GmbH and BMBF ""BioProfil"" (0313092), by European Commission under FP6 ""Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health"" contract LSHG-CT-2004-503568 ""COMBIO"".","1.

²Institute of Cytology & Genetics SB RAN, 10 Lavrentyev pr., 630090, Novosibirsk, Russia",oke@biobase.de,"The TRANSCompel® database is devoted to the particular aspect of gene transcriptional regulation [1-7]. It contains information about composite elements - the basic structures of combinatorial gene regulation [7]. Composite regulatory elements consist of two or three closely situated binding sites for distinct transcription factors (TFs), and represent minimal functional units providing combinatorial transcriptional regulation. Both specific factor-DNA and factor-factor interactions contribute to the function of composite elements. Each database entry corresponds to an individual composite element within a particular gene and contains information about two or three binding sites, the corresponding TFs, experiments confirming cooperative action between TFs. Interacting factors may differ by the structure of DNA-binding, activation, oligomerization and other domains. Along with structural differences, functional properties of TFs and hence their specific contribution to the transcription regulation may significantly vary. Co-operative action of the TFs within the composite elements results in a new highly specific pattern of gene transcription that cannot be provided by the involved factors separately. Composite elements are structural-functional units that provide cross-coupling of gene regulatory pathways and, in particular, cross-coupling of signal transduction pathways. There are two main types of composite elements: synergistic and antagonistic ones. In synergistic CEs, simultaneous interactions of two factors with closely situated target sites results in a non-additive high level of a transcriptional activation. Within an antagonistic CE two factors interfere with each other. Information about the structure of known composite elements and specific gene regulation achieved through such composite elements appears to be extremely useful for promoter prediction, for gene function prediction and for applied gene engineering as well. A program CATCH® for searching potential composite elements in DNA sequences has been developed. A sequence under study is scanned by this program using all composite elements collected in TRANSCompel® as individual searching patterns. Several parameters are available restricting the search: maximal mismatches in the cores of site1 and site2 comprising the composite elements, maximal variation of the distance between two sites, and composite score cut-off value. The composite score reflects how well the match coincides with the known examples of the composite elements in TRANSCompel®. This scoring function takes into account the number of mismatches in both sites and the distance between them. All found matches are directly linked to the TRANSCompel® entries containing the corresponding composite elements.","TRANScompel® 7.0 Public consists of two interlinked tables. The COMPEL table contains general information about the composite elements including sequence, positions, gene, names of cooperating transcription factors as well as a brief list of the experimental evidence. The EVIDENCE table provides detailed information about the experimental evidence confirming physical and functional interactions between the corresponding transcription factors. Genes and transcription factors are linked to the corresponding entries in the TRANSFAC® database [8]. TRANSCompel® 7.0 Public contains information about 322 composite regulatory elements. This version of TRANSCompel® equipped with the search and browse tools is available at http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/databases.html#transcompel.

It compares these collections, deciding which entries should be consolidated and which are discrete. Since the gene annotations use the same assembly and coordinate scheme, GeneLoc effects this gene integration by comparing genomic locations. The resulting GeneLoc 'gene territory' reflects the range of the unified genes, taking into account every exon.
Additionally, DNA segments, classified by categories (such as STSs mapped by various methods and EST clusters) are presented, alongside the genes, on a Megabase-scale map, with further information and links to relevant databases.

Under the hypothesis that genes from distantly related species have different nucleotide compositions, these deviated genes may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. The methods used to consider whether a gene is extraneous in terms of G+C content or codon usage and a candidate to be acquired by HGT are described in Garcia-Vallve et al. 2000. The HGT-DB is organized by genome i.e. every prokaryotic genome that has been completely sequenced forms a new entry. Different chromosomes from the same organism, or genomes from the same species but different strains, are found in different entries. The current version of the database contains 88 genomes that are sorted alphabetically and classified taxonomically. For each genome, the database provides statistical parameters for all the genes, as well as averages and standard deviations of G+C content, codon usage, relative synonymous codon usage and amino-acid content. It also provides information about correspondence analyses of the codon usage, plus lists of extraneous group of genes in terms of G+C content, lists of putatively acquired genes and a tab-delimited file with all the statistical calculations for each gene of a genome. The fields available for each gene in these files are: information about its position (coordinates, strand and length), gene name, function, the Cluster of Orthologous Group, COG it belongs to, total and positional G+C content, the Mahalanobis distance to the average codon usage, amino-acid content deviations, if any, and a prediction of whether the gene belongs to a region with a high or low G+C content or whether it has been acquired by HGT. This information can be also accessed via a search engine that allows searches for gene names or keywords for a specific organism. When searching for a gene name, one can also view the upstream and downstream genes. With this information, researchers can explore the G+C content and codon usage of a gene when they find incongruences in sequence-based phylogenetic trees.

The database contains a compilation of nearly all published HIV RT and protease sequences, including submissions to GenBank, sequences published in journal articles, and sequences of HIV isolates from persons participating in clinical trials. Sequences are linked to data about the source of the sequence, the antiretroviral drug treatment history of the person from whom the sequence was obtained and the results of in vitro drug susceptibility testing. Sequence data on two new molecular targets of HIV drug therapy ¯ gp41 (cell fusion) and integrase ¯ will be added to the database shortly.","Antiretroviral drug resistance is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. A large number of retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated that the presence of drug resistance before starting a treatment regimen is an independent predictor of success of that regimen (1). As a result, several expert panels have recommended that HIV RT and protease sequencing be done to help physicians select antiretroviral drugs for their patients and genotypic resistance testing has been part of routine clinical care for the past several years (2). The HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database (HIVRT&PrDB) is intended to assist scientists designing new HIV-1 drugs, clinical investigators studying HIV-1 drug resistance, and clinicians using genotypic HIV-1 drug resistance tests (3). The database links sequence changes in the molecular targets of HIV-1 therapy to other forms of data including treatment history and phenotypic (drug susceptibility) data. Data on the virological response (plasma HIV-1 RNA levels) to a new treatment regimen have been added and will soon be accessible over the web. The HIVRT&PrDB is a relational database with 19 normalized (nonredundant) core tables, 10 look-up tables, and about 20 derived tables. The database is implemented using MySQL on a Linux platform. There are several major hierarchical relationships linking key entities in the database: (i) patient Ã‚Â\x81¨ treatment history (list of drug regimens and their start and stop dates); (ii) patient Ã‚Â\x81¨ isolate (clinical) Ã‚Â\x81¨ sequence Ã‚Â\x81¨ drug susceptibility result; (iii) isolate (laboratory) Ã‚Â\x81¨ drug susceptibility result, (iv) patient Ã‚Â\x81¨ plasma HIV-1 RNA level.

The HIVRT&PrDB contains data from more than 420 published papers. Sequences are available on HIV-1 isolates from more than 7,000 individuals and from about 500 laboratory isolates containing mutations generated by virus passage or site-directed mutagenesis. About 20,000 drug susceptibility results from tests performed on more than 2,000 virus isolates are available. Figure 1 and 2 contain composite alignments showing 193 protease and 395 RT mutations present at a frequency of >0.1% in HIV-1 isolates from treated and untreated persons. Figure 3 shows a summary of the drug susceptibility results available on each of the 16 approved antiretroviral drugs. The database allows users to retrieve sets of sequences meeting specific criteria. Commonly submitted queries include (i) the retrieval of sequences of HIV-1 isolates from patients receiving a specific drug treatment, (ii) the retrieval of sequences of HIV-1 isolates containing mutations at specific protease or RT positions, (iii) the retrieval of drug susceptibility data on HIV-1 isolates containing specific mutations or combinations of mutations, and (iv) a summary of data in any particular reference. Each query initially returns data in the form of a table and each record in the returned table contains 8 or more columns of data. The data returned include (i) hyperlinks to the MEDLINE abstract and GenBank record, (ii) a list of mutations in the sequence, (iii) a classification of the sequence by patient and time point, (iv) drug treatment history, and (v) additional data depending upon the query (e.g., drug susceptibility results, phylogenetic data, technical data about virus isolation and sequencing). Together with this table users are given the option of downloading or viewing the raw sequence data in a variety of formats. Sequence interpretation programs The database website contains three sequence interpretation programs. The first program, HIVseq, accepts user-submitted RT and protease sequences, compares them to a reference sequence, and uses the differences (mutations) as query parameters for interrogating the database (4). HIVseq allows users to examine new sequences in the context of previously published sequences, providing two main advantages. First, unusual sequence results can be detected and immediately rechecked. Second, unexpected associations between sequences or isolates can be discovered when the program retrieves data on isolates sharing one or more mutations with the new sequence. The second program, a drug resistance interpretation program (HIVdb), accepts user-submitted protease and RT sequences and returns inferred levels of resistance to the 16 FDA-approved antiretroviral drugs. Each drug resistance mutation is assigned a drug penalty score; the total score for a drug is derived by adding the scores associated with each mutation. Using the total drug score, the program reports one of the following levels of inferred drug resistance: susceptible, potential low-level resistance, low-level resistance, intermediate resistance, and high-level resistance. The third program (HIValg), allows researchers to compare the output of different publicly available drug-resistance algorithms on the same sequence or set of sequences. The algorithms used by this program are encoded using a programming platform or Algorithm Specification Interface (ASI) developed to facilitate the comparison of HIV genotypic resistance algorithms. ASI consists of an XML format for specifying an algorithm and a compiler that transforms the XML into executable code. New additions planned for the HIVRT&PrDB Two additions to the database are planned: (i) gp41 sequences and data on resistance to fusion inhibitors. The first fusion inhibitor, enfuvirtide (T-20) has been shown to have potent antiretroviral activity in clinical trials (5,6) and is likely to be approved in 2003. A wide range of mutations in gp41 contributing to T-20 resistance, most occurring between residues 36-45, have been reported, but mutations outside of this region also appear to contribute to drug resistance(7,8). (ii) integrase sequences. A new class of compounds that inhibit HIV-1 integrase have been shown to be active in vitro and in a SHIV rhesus macaque model of infection (9,10).",The project was supported in part by NIH/NIAID (AI-46148-02) and a Stanford University BioX Interdisciplinary Project Grant.,"1.

Their evolutionary proliferation has been driven by the need to provide recognition capacity for millions of potential odorants with arbitrary chemical configuration. The Human Olfactory Receptor Data Exploratorium (http://bioportal.weizmann.ac.il/HORDE, HORDE), is a database which aim to provide a comprehensive view of the human OR universe. Currently, HORDE contains 853 OR entries, of which 386 have an intact open reading frame and the rest are probable pseudogenes. This collection constitutes the most update repertoire of human ORs, deciphered by computational data-mining procedure out of the public and Celera genomic complete human genome assemblies. To allow orthologues-paralogues comparisons, HORDE includes information on ORs from other mammalian species - mouse, dog and chimpanzee. Based on phylogenetic analysis, HORDE classifies the OR repertoire into seventeen families. A HUGO-approved systematic nomenclature is provided, which affords an instant guide to the position of a gene in a phylogenetic tree: OR1A2 signifies family 1, subfamily A, member 2.
Interface. HORDE is equipped with a user-friendly interface which allows a facile data retrieval. A key feature in HORDE is a card for every OR gene, which summerizes most comprehensive information into a single HTML page, including hyperlinks to other databases. Several search engines, including BLAST tool, are supplied.","Cluster viewer. The OR genes are distributed in clusters on most human chromosomes. The cluster viewer facilitates browsing of the ORs organization along human chromosomes. HORDE includes information on 135 OR clusters, ranging in size from nearly 100 ORs to singletons.

In the absence of any structural evidence and natural intermediate sequences, detecting distant evolutionary relationships is a challenging task. Large gaps, between related families, in the sequence space can be bridged through the design of protein-like sequences [1, 2]. In our recent publication [1], we developed a computational algorithm to design protein-like intermediate sequences between related protein families. 3,611,010 artificial sequences were designed between pairs of related protein families for 374 multi-membered SCOP-folds (1.75v). Such computationally designed intermediately related sequences when augmented into commonly employed databases enable detection of remote relationships. Through the NrichD database resource, we provide designed sequences plugged into commonly employed structure and sequence databases [3, 4] for the user to perform homology searches. These enriched databases (SCOP-NrichD and Pfam-NrichD), their respective natural sequence databases (SCOP-DB and Pfam-DB) and the dataset of artificial sequences (AS-DB) can be freely downloaded from the website. User can also perform jackhmmer [5] searches against these enriched databases through the web-portal. Searches are made additionally in their respective natural sequence database to achieve maximum coverage. These intermediate sequences are annotated with their parent profiles, which makes iterative searches traceable and help in fold recognition. Another useful feature provided by the web-server is to generate sequences for or between related families. User can define SCOP domain families or provide a multiple sequence alignments of the protein families and generate artificial sequences at different level of divergence.","NrichD database (version 1) constitute 4 major databases namely, SCOP(v1.75)-DB, SCOP(v1.75)-NrichD, Pfam(v27.0)-DB and Pfam(v27.0)-NrichD and a dataset of computationally designed intermediate sequences (AS-DB, version1). Update for these computationally designed protein-like sequences will be released with every SCOP database update. This update will also extend to the SCOP-NrichD dataset. Likewise, Pfam-DB and Pfam-NrichD datasets will be updated with each update of Pfam.","NrichD database is supported by Mathematical Biology program of Department of Science and Technology as well as by the Department of Biotechnology (Grant code: BT/01/COE/09/01), Government of India.","1.

³Genome Science Division, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST), University of Tokyo, Japan",m-suwa@aist.go.jp,"Seven-transmembrane-helix receptors (7-TMR), known as G-protein-coupled receptors [1], are important genes that work as the gateway of signal transudation induced by ligand binding. Recent progress in determination of human draft sequences [2,3] accelerates the comprehensive analysis of 7-TMR in whole human genome. We have developed an automated system for discovering 7-TMR genes in the whole human genome by three stages. (I) Gene prediction stage: Genomic sequences were obtained from human genome resources of NCBI . To maximize the number of gene candidates, we detected three kinds of sequence sets, (a)""6f-sequences"" which were all possible combination between initial and stop codons in 6 reading frames. (b)""ALN-sequences"" obtained by ALN [4], which is a dynamic programming algorithm that assigns genome sequence to known protein sequence. (c)""GD-sequences"" generated by GeneDecoder [5] which is based on HMM models. (II)Screening stage: The predicted genes passed an analyzing filter using items of BLASTP [6] for similarity search, HMMER [7] and in house program for assigning 7-TMR specific HMM. (PFAM domain [7] ), PROSITE patterns [8] and transmembrane helix (TMH) prediction tools [9]. By carefully assessing each component, two threshold settings, best specificity and best sensitivity, were determined. Then four confidence levels of the datasets were obtained by combining the best specificity and best sensitivity thresholds. (III) Quality improvement stage: Sequence redundancies were adjusted as follows. (1) Pair-wise alignment was applied to the candidate sequences in all-against-all fashion. (2) Sequences were linked together only when they hit for > 50 A.A residues with > 95% identity and shared the same chromosome No., and overlapping genetic position. (3)The result of a transitive closure of the links was then regarded as one cluster. And one representative gene was selected from each cluster. Applying this system to human genome sequences (Apr, 2003), we collected 7-TMR genes in four confidence levels ranging from 1,114 candidates at the highest specificity to 2,235 at the highest sensitivity. These are summarized in SEVENS (http://sevens.cbrc.jp/1.20/). This database intends to cover all ""7-TMR universe"" with not only the known sequences but also to use newly discovered sequence by computational gene finding program. This aspect is clearly different from previous databases [10-12]. The content search button navigates a page, where candidates are obtained. by the ""AND"" combination of (a) Keyword in nr.aa database search results, (b)Chromosome number, (c)Data Level, (d)Predicted exon number, (e) Gene Length, (f)Protein length, (g)E-value of sequence search against SWISSPROT or nr.aa, (h) Prosite motifs, and (i) Pfam domains. This search lists up 7-TMR candidate sequences at a chromosomal viewer and a list table. Then each chromosome or sequence links to the sequence analysis page. Here, chromosomal viewer shows the mapping information of selected genes (purple) which links to their protein sequence analysis. Result of Similarity Search part shows an alignment of the query searched against SWISS-PROT and nr.aa database. using BLASTP. Structure part shows the results of analysis, with TMH prediction, PROSITE motif pattern and PFAM domain in amino acid sequence. We are planning to maintain SEVENS with constant updates according to the version up of human genome sequence. Additional information (such as expression data, tertiary structure data etc.) will be included in database with every update chance.

The main purpose of MVP (Microbe Versus Phage) is to provide a comprehensive catalog of phageâ€“microbe interactions and assist users to select phage(s) that can target (and potentially to manipulate) specific microbes of interest. We first collected 50 782 viral sequences from various sources and clustered them into 33 097 unique viral clusters based on sequence similarity. We then identified 26 572 interactions between 18 608 viral clusters and 9245 prokaryotes (i.e. bacteria and archaea); we established these interactions based on 30 321 evidence entries that we collected from published datasets, public databases and re-analysis of genomic and metagenomic sequences. Based on these interactions, we calculated the host range for each of the phage clusters and accordingly grouped them into subgroups such as â€˜species-â€™, â€˜genus-â€™ and â€˜family-â€™ specific phage clusters.

²European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Meyerhofstr. 1, 69012 Heidelberg, Germany",rebecca.wade@eml.villa-bosch.de,"DSMM is a Database of Simulated Molecular Motions. This database is designed to serve as a single searchable site for locating movies and animations from simulations of biomolecules. DSMM is accessible via a webserver at: http://projects.villa-bosch.de/dbase/dsmm/. Many molecular modeling and simulation studies have contributed to our understanding of biomolecular dynamics. Movies of trajectories from molecular simulations and animations consisting of concatenated snapshots of molecules provide a valuable means to visualize the results of such studies. They are insightful in the research context and a useful teaching aid in the classroom. Such movies often summarize the results of many CPU hours of simulation. However, they are rarely to be found in the final published results. Instead, many authors put their movies on their own web pages. This means that it is not easy to find out which movies are available, and searching for particular movies is a somewhat haphazard and unreliable process. Consequently, we decided to build a web-accessible database, DSMM, which would store information on molecular movies at a single location where they could be easily searched and located. All movies collected in DSMM are results from simulations including molecular dynamics, Brownian dynamics, docking, energy minimization, NMR refinement and QM/MM calculations. Some of these simulations are run with the aim of obtaining a realistic picture of the dynamics of molecules as a function of time. In other cases, simulation techniques are used to derive specific information related to molecular function, such as low energy conformations or thermodynamic quantities. In the latter cases, movies can illuminate certain aspects of a molecule's function or how a particular simulation technique works, e.g. how a simulation-based ligand-docking technique converges on docked solutions. DSMM consequently contains movies of 'molecular motions' that are all 'simulated' but that may illustrate quite diverse aspects of molecular dynamics. There are currently over 100 movies collected in DSMM. Authors are encouraged to enter their own movies into DSMM via the movie submission webpage.",,Financial support by the Klaus Tschira Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.,"Giacomo Finocchiaro, Ting Wang, Rene Hoffmann, Aitor Gonzalez and Rebecca C.

In the GOA project, this vocabulary is being applied to a non-redundant set of proteins described in the EBI's core genome and proteome databases (UniProt Knowledgebase, InterPro and Ensembl) that collectively provide complete and incomplete proteomes for human (GOA-Human), mouse (GOA-Mouse) and rat (GOA-Rat) as well as many other organisms (GOA-UniProt). GOA is produced by electronic and manual techniques and is updated monthly, in accordance with the latest data released by its core databases. The production of GOA-Human is in keeping with our GO Consortium agreement to fast track the functional annotation of the human proteome and with our Human Proteomics Initiative. The release of all our annotation (for >76,000 species) via GOA-UniProt has made the EBI one of the largest resources of GO annotation by providing nearly 5 million annotations (see Statistics on GOA home page). The GOA project also ensures maintenance and sharing of GO mappings to Swiss-Prot keywords and InterPro. These mappings provide a useful resource of functional information for the analysis of microarray and mass spectrometry data. The GOA project also ensures that at least some of the existing corpus of scientific knowledge in our core databases is converted into a computationally accessible form. By annotating all characterized proteins with GO terms and facilitating the transfer of this knowledge to similar uncharacterized proteins, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of all proteomes.
The success and accuracy of our GO annotations rely on frequent electronic and manual checking. We actively encourage updates or corrections and new collaborations from the scientific community to improve this shared resource.

In addition to gene-drug relationships, the PharmGKB also contains data on gene variation, genomics, gene-disease relationships, drug action, and pathways. The PharmGKB has developed highly curated pathways documenting the genes involved in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of aselection of drugs and aims to enrich these by exchange with other metabolic and signaling pathway resources using BioPAX exchange format. We developed an XML format for defining genotype data, a relational database schema for data storage, and a flexible mechanism for submitting phenotype data. We are participating in the PML effort to define an XML standard for genotype/phenotype data exchange. Finally, we created a community project that encourages the research community to submit pharmacogenomic knowledge from the literature. PharmGKB first came online in April 2000. Access is free but requires users to register for a username and password for viewing individual subject data, in order to comply with HIPAA regulations.
CATEGORIES OF EVIDENCE To establish a link between a genetic variation and variation in a phenotype, many different types of experiments can be performed, ranging from genotypic studies to cellular phenotype assays, to clinical studies. It is problematic to search a database with such diverse data types. We associate all experimental results with a category of evidence, which provides the context for its significance. We use five categories, and all data entering PharmGKB must be labeled with one of them. If a study shows a significant difference in a clinical outcome (death, disability, pain, days of work missed) based on a genetic difference, then the data falls under the Clinical Outcome category. The Pharmacodynamics and Drug Response category consists of studies that have shown a variation in a drug response that can be measured clinically, but is not a direct outcome. The Pharmacokinetics category quantifies how drug metabolism changes based on genetic changes, and Molecular and Cellular Functional Assays show associations between genetic changes and changes in functional assay results. Finally, the Genotype category contains data showing basic variability in gene sequences. We show the Category of Evidence for all data being displayed, as well as appropriate literature annotations and cross-references to external databases. We expect that researchers will direct their hypotheses into those areas where data is sparse.
PHENOTYPE DATA While much work has been done to create an XML and associated database schema for describing information about genetic variation, the PharmGKB is also focused on collecting phenotypic data associated with genetic variation. There are inherent difficulties of attempting to create a database schema for phenotypic data because of the vast range of clinical studies, each with specialized methods of reporting results. Therefore, PharmGKB initially took a library approach to accepting phenotypic data. We accept annotated spreadsheet data from researchers, who also provide us with the Category of Evidence of the data, the gene-drug relationships, and keywords for finding the data. We store and index the data in the database and link to related research information. We present a unified view with the Categories of Evidence, such that users can easily access all information related to a drug-gene relationship. Users searching our site can then view and download phenotype data. We are actively engaged in the PML effort (2) to create a standard for the definition, storage, and exchange of phenotype data via XML.
DATABASE UPGRADES Qualitative analysis of our system has shown that having a frame-based data storage facility suffered in retrieval performance. While the use of a frame-base system provided a flexible means for early data modeling, a database backend has shown better performance in storing and retrieving information. (3) Data is now stored centrally in a relational database. 4) We are beginning to accept large, high-throughput datasets, including whole-genome analyses, and are preparing to meet the challenges of future datasets in the multi-gigabyte-to-terabyte range.","In an effort to build up a repository of drug-gene relationships, we have created the Community-Based Pharmacogenetic Information Project, which allows the scientific community to submit information about gene-drug relationships while specifying a Category of Evidence and citing a source for the information. We expect that by encouraging the community to submit pharmacogenomic associations that they deem important, we can capture relationships and solicit data sets that may have been overlooked. Users can also search through this repository to discover relationships between genes or drugs of interest, and direct research into those areas.
We have released an extensive XML schema that describes our object model, the relationships among the categories of evidence, and encompasses fundamental objects such as genes, drugs, and chromosomes. We are committed to using and supporting open source projects, to encourage other informatics groups to benefit from our code and from our knowledge representations.","PharmGKB is financially supported by grants from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and National Library of Medicine (NLM) within the National Institutes of Health (U01GM61374; Russ Altman, PI).","1.

Popular genomes summarized include human, mouse, rat, fruitfly, mosquito, Caenorhabditis elegans worm, Saccharomyces yeast, Arabidopsis mustard weed and zebrafish. This information, automatically updated from source databases, offers several features useful to bioscientists looking for gene relationships across organisms. The database describes over 200,000 genes, using reference database gene names and IDs, along with BLAST homologies and associations with molecular functions, cell locations and biological processes. Included are whole-genome maps locating millions of features and molecular data, and options to retrieve sequences, and run BLAST comparisions. Search and retrieval of genome data is easy and quick, allowing one to ask combined questions of sequence features, protein functions and other gene attributes, and fetch results as web reports or bulk database formats, for integration in other projects such as gene expression databases.","Year 2003 updates include addition of mosquito and rat genomes. Addition of rice, Fugu, chimpanzee, Daphnia and other eukaryote genomes is in progress. Extended flexibility of euGenes is available now with redesign as a common, replicable genome information system Argos (http://eugenes.org/argos/). It can be copied and run on scientists's Unix computers, including MacOSX, Linux and Solaris, with minimal effort and knowledge of Unix.

The database compiles topology and signal sequence predictions and displays the results in a directly comparable graphical output format for presently 7139 genes/proteins. The reliability of TM prediction is improved by calculating a consensus TM prediction. ARAMEMNON also contains experimental intracellular localization data from the literature, a comprehensive bibliography and many other features for data mining and sequence interpretation of Arabidopsis membrane proteins. ARAMEMNON is accessible at the URL http://aramemnon.botanik.uni-koeln.de.
The database query options are:
-text strings in gene annotations, locus names, GenBank accession numbers or BAC names,
-signal sequence/subcellular targeting predictions (plastids, mitochondria or the secretory pathway),
-proteins with a user-defined range of TM spans,
-predicted N-terminus orientation towards the cytoplasma or the extra-cytoplasmic space,

The previous non-redundant classification[1], based on the SCOP40 set, has also been updated. Currently, the SCOP90-based classification contains 46894 motifs clustered into 2029 classes and 5111 subclasses, and the SCOP40-based classification contains 24356 motifs clustered into 1221 classes and 3575 subclasses. In addition, a manually curated classification of a subset of kinase proteins, ArchKI, has been included[4]. Functional annotations concerning residues found within clustered motifs has been incorporated into ArchDB, such as small ligand contacts (within 6.0 Ã…) and PDB SITE and ACTSITE records[5]. SCOP domain classification and protein functional descriptors such as EC numbers[6] and GO terms[7] are also reported. Subclasses displaying conserved functional or structural annotations (above 75%) are reported.","Residues involved in small ligand contacts (within 6.0 Ã…) are reported for every motif. PDB records have been parsed and PDB SITE and ACTSITE information concerning residues found within in clustered motifs is also reported. Subclasses displaying either small ligand contacts or PDB information conserved in at least 75% of its member motifs are annotated as potential functional subclasses. Conserved protein annotations within a subclass may also suggest a structural or functional link. Therefore, subclasses with SCOP identifiers, GO terms or EC numbers found to be conserved with percentages of conservation chosen by the user are reported in the web. Ongoing developments include an Enzyme-specific classification set, a bootstrapping-based method to identify putative functional motifs and loop search algorithm, ArchFit. The algorithm performs rigid body bracing structure fitting and sequence scoring by conformation-specific sequence substitution statistical potentials combined with the subclass-specific sequence profile (manuscript in preparation).","B.O. acknowledges grants from FundaciÃ“n Areces (Spain) and from MCYT (Ministerio de Ciencia y TecnologÃ\x8Da, Spain; ref.

The process of recombination at the molecular level has generated a wide variety of multi-domain proteins with specific domain organization to cater to the functional requirements of an organism. The functional and structural costs of inserting a domain into another means that multi-domain proteins are usually formed by covalently linking the N-terminus of one domain to the C-terminus of the preceding domain. While this is true in a large proportion of multi-domain proteins, we find a significant fraction of proteins that are the result of domain insertion. The inserted domain breaks the sequence contiguity of the domain into which it is inserted leading to a novel domain organization.

Since 1992 the list has been updated electronically by use of the web. In parallel with this process all published recommendations by the Committee were also converted to a web readable form. More recent changes to Enzyme Nomenclature and new recommendations have only been prepared for the web and are not available in hard copy.
The Enzyme Nomenclature list is an amplified and updated version of the 1992 edition. It currently contains details of over 3700 enzymes. It was prepared from the last printed edition, Enzyme Nomenclature 1992 (1) which was converted into html with additional data added. In many cases the reaction is given in words and illustrated with a reaction diagram (which may be part of a metabolic pathway). Other names for each enzyme are added and links are provided to other databases (BRENDA, EXPASY, KEGG, WIT, etc) and the CAS registry number provided when known. The references now have titles and link where relevant to the PubMed entry.
Enzymes are classified into six classes -- EC 1 oxidoreductases, EC 2 transferases, EC 3 hydrolases, EC 4 lyases, EC 5 isomersaes and EC 6 ligases. The search facility allows searches of all enzyme entries and each class separately.
Updates with new entries, revisions and corrections are posted on the web at regular intervals for review.

IMGT/3Dstructure-DB contains 3D structures of immunoglobulins (IG) (5) or antibodies, T cell receptors (TR) (6), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, antigen receptor/antigen complexes (IG/Ag, TR/peptide/MHC) of vertebrates; 3D structures of related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of vertebrates and invertebrates, belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and MHC superfamily (MhcSF). The IMGT/3Dstructure-DB structural data are extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (7) and annotated according to the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts of classification (8,9), using internal tools and IMGT/DomainGapAlign. IMGT/3Dstructure-DB provides IMGT gene and allele identification (CLASSIFICATION), region and domain delimitations (DESCRIPTION), amino acid positions according to the IMGT unique numbering (NUMEROTATION) (10-12) that are used in IMGT/3Dstructure-DB cards, results of contact analysis and renumbered flat files. IMGT/3Dstructure-DB provides the IMGT Colliers de Perles (13) that are 2D graphical representations based on the IMGT unique numbering, the key IMGT-ONTOLOGY concept of numerotation. IMGT Colliers de Perles are currently available for three domain types: V type (that includes the V-DOMAIN of IG and TR, and V-LIKE-DOMAIN of the IgSF other than IG and TR) (10), C type (that includes the C-DOMAIN of IG and TR, and C-LIKE- DOMAIN of the IgSF other than IG and TR) (11) and G type (that includes the G-DOMAIN of MHC, and G-LIKE-DOMAIN of the MhcSF other than MHC) (12). IMGT/DomainGapAlign tool analyses amino acid sequences, per domain. Coupled to the IMGT/Collier-de-Perles tool, it provides an invaluable help for antibody engineering and humanization design based on complementarity determining region (CDR) grafting as it precisely defines the standardized framework regions (FR-IMGT) and CDR-IMGT. Moreover the IMGT unique numbering facilitates the identification of potential immunogenic residues at given positions in chimeric or humanized antibodies, including those of the constant domains. The IMGT standardization has allowed to build a unique frame for the comparison of the IG, TR and MHC structural data and interactions with their ligands.

IMGT/GENE-DB is part of IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system® (1,2), the high-quality integrated knowledge resource specialized in IG, TR, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of human and other vertebrate species, and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and to the MHC superfamily (MhcSF). IMGT/GENE-DB annotated data are extracted from IMGT Repertoire, the global ImMunoGeneTics Web Resource, and from the IMGT/LIGM-DB database (3). All the human IMGT gene names (4,5) were approved by the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) in 1999 (6), and entered in the Genome DataBase GDB (Canada) and in LocusLink and Entrez Gene at NCBI (USA). IMGT/GENE-DB allows a search of IG and TR gene entries by locus, group, subgroup, based on the CLASSIFICATION axiom of IMGT-ONTOLOGY (7,8). A shortcut allows users to search genes by selection of gene name (according to the IMGT nomenclature) or clone name(s) (data from the ""Reference sequences"" and ""Sequences from the literature"" columns in IMGT Repertoire>Germline genes tables). IMGT/GENE-DB entries provide, for each gene, the chromosomal localization, the gene name and definition, the number of alleles, links to IMGT Repertoire and to external sequence (EMBL, GenBank, DDBJ) and genome (e.g., GDB, Entrez Gene, OMIM) databases. IMGT/GENE-DB provides for each allele the functionality, the clone names, the IMGT/LIGM-DB reference sequence accession numbers (with link to the flat file), and the ""IMGT/GENE-DB reference sequences in FASTA format"" (nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the coding regions extracted from the IMGT/LIGM-DB reference sequence), with gaps according to the IMGT unique numbering (9,10) (based on the IMGT Scientific chart rules and on the NUMEROTATION axiom of IMGT-ONTOLOGY).

The IG and TR primers are useful for combinatorial library constructions, antibody single chain Fragment variable (scFv), phage display or microarray technologies. IMGT/PRIMER-DB is part of IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system®, http://www.imgt.org (1,2), the high-quality integrated knowledge resource specialized in IG, TR, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of human and other vertebrate species, and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF)and to the MHC superfamily (MhcSF). IMGT/PRIMER-DB contains information on primers and combinations of primers described as ""sets"" [primers sharing identical properties (species, group and orientation)] and ""couples"" [sets of opposite orientation for which IMGT/LIGM-DB sequences are known (or expected)]. Primers, Sets and Couples are described in IMGT Primer cards, IMGT Set cards and IMGT Couple cards, respectively. An IMGT Primer is an oligonucleotide described by comparison to an IMGT/LIGM-DB reference sequence, according to the standardized rules of the IMGT Scientific chart, based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY axioms and concepts (3,4). Taxonomic species and IMGT classification (group, subgroup, gene, allele) of a primer are those of the IMGT/LIGM-DB reference sequence, and not those of the PCR amplification products. This provides the following advantages for data standardization: IMGT/PRIMER-DB primer definition, classification and description are independent from the experimental conditions, from DNA sources and from the different combinations (sets and couples) in which the primer can be used. This means that (i) the specificity of a primer (subgroup, gene or allele specific) which is either described experimentally or deduced from sequence comparison is not used for the primer classification, although these data are provided in the IMGT/PRIMER-DB Primer card in ""Classification comments and specificity"", (ii) the sequences resulting from the PCR amplifications are uniquely associated to the couples. The IMGT Primer cards are linked to IMGT/LIGM-DB flat files, IMGT Colliers de Perles and IMGT Repertoire Alignments of alleles of the IMGT/LIGM-DB reference sequence used for the primer description.

To utilize the database for both closely related and distantly related genomes, MBGD previously provided two types of ortholog tables: the standard ortholog table containing one representative genome from each genus covering the entire taxonomic range and the taxon specific ortholog tables for each taxon. However, this approach has a drawback in that the standard ortholog table contains only genes that are conserved in the representative genomes. To address this problem, we developed a stepwise procedure to construct ortholog tables hierarchically in a bottom-up manner. By using this approach, the new standard ortholog table now covers the entire gene repertoire stored in MBGD.

This database can be viewed as an additional feature to the mainstream database of PASS2 (Mallika et al., 2002) for every single member superfamily. The template regions have been identified on the basis of sequence conservation and structural information content. Conserved regions, recognized by permitted amino acid exchanges, are mapped on the structure and various structural features (solvent inaccessibility, secondary structure content, hydrogen bonding and residue packing) are examined. Conserved regions with high structural conservation are projected for the particular superfamily member. Interactive three-dimensional displays of the motifs in the superposed structure (in Chime® and RASMOL) are provided for better understanding and visualization. The conserved regions or templates can be projected as important signatures or minimum structural requirement for that particular superfamily.

At this moment, the MOsDB database includes current (updated on daily basis) published sequences and gene annotation information of two Oryza sativa subspecies: japonica and indica. Currenty (Jan. 2005), MOsDB houses over 60000 gene calls on the pseudomolecule assembly (12 chromosomes) as provided by TIGR (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1/index.shtml). When the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP) genome sequence and annotation becomes available, that will be included in parallel.
To browse data, the user can navigate in a genome-oriented way. Starting from a chromosome list, one can retrieve detailed information on the chromsosome as well as links to sequence and genetic elements. The genetic element list links to reports on the protein genes or other features on display. Sequences can be viewed and downloaded as HTML, XML, FASTA and GAMEXML (Apollo annotation tool compatible) format.

This requires the biochemical characterization of expressed proteins in various hosts. To facilitate the protein expression in a high throughput fashion, Invitrogen initiated an ORFeome program about one and half years ago. This ORFeome program is intended to provide the Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of all human proteins to researchers in academics and government, biotech and pharmaceutical industries. Each ORF was PCR-amplified using gene specific primer set from cDNA clone or library and the amplified DNA fragment was cloned into Gateway entry vector using recombination based cloning in a high throughput format. The positive ORF clone was then subject to full-insert sequence verification. The qualified ORF clones are guaranteed to match 100% to public protein sequence. Last December, we launched a web based ORFBrowser to allow users to query our ORFeome database. The ORFBrowser provides not only standard query tools like blast and keyword search, but also advanced browse by Gene Ontology, and a fast and flexible ID search in a batch mode. Using GO Browser, users can easily browse through the ORF collections based on biological processes, cellular component, and molecular function. Using the ID search, the user can query ORFeome database using the IDs such as Unigene ID, LocusLinkID, Gene Symbol, gene accession number and protein accession number or the combination of these IDs, in a batch mode with up to 10,000 IDs in a single query. In addition, Each ORF has been annotated extensively and the annotation of each ORF is captured in the ORFCard, which is summarized in six categories: Gene, ORF, Clone, Protein, SNP and Genomic links.
1. Gene information contains the gene definition, function annotation, related accessions, gene symbol, GO classification, links for CGAP gene expression profile and PubMed references.
2. ORF information contains the ORF size, nucleotide and protein sequences as well as Phred quality values for each base of the ORF.
3. Clone information has the vector type, host cell and clone collection.
4. Protein annotation includes the basic feature of the protein, function annotation, related accessions, protease digestion profile, disease link with OMIM id, secondary structure prediction as well as the links to map the protein to well-known protein domain mapping sites like, PFAM, Prosite, SMART and link to map the protein to SwissModel
5. SNP information contains the links to NCBI SNP database.
6. Genomic Links include links to Unigene, LocusLink, Ensembl, MGI, as well as the link to map the protein to Human genomic backbone using online UCSC Blat tool.
With this ORFCard, the users can easily access the most current information for the ORF of interest in various categories with their finger click. The access of this information is absolutely free of charge to anyone and the user has no obligation to buy the ORF clones.
Currently, the ORFeome database has 4500 human ORFs and 2800 mouse ORFs. We will be releasing 2000 clones every three months. To our knowledge, ORFeome database provides the largest ORF collection for human and mouse Open Reading Frames and these ORF clones will facilitate the function dissection of individual proteins.",,,,Human and other Vertebrate Genomes,Human ORFs,,,,,

The PIRSF classification system accommodates a flexible number of levels that reflect varying degrees of sequence conservation from superfamily to subfamily levels, allowing improved protein annotation, more accurate extraction of conserved functional residues, and classification of distantly related orphan proteins. The primary PIRSF classification unit is the homeomorphic family, whose members are both homologous (evolved from a common ancestor) and homeomorphic (sharing full-length sequence similarity and a common domain architecture). The PIRSF database consists of two data sets, preliminary clusters and curated families. PIRSF families are curated systematically based on literature review and integrative sequence and functional analysis, including sequence and structure similarity, domain architecture, functional association, genome context, and phyletic pattern. The results of classification and expert annotation are summarized in PIRSF family reports with graphical viewers for taxonomic distribution, domain architecture, family hierarchy, and multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree. The PIRSF system provides a comprehensive resource for bioinformatics analysis and comparative studies of protein function and evolution. Domain searches allow identification of evolutionarily related protein families sharing domains or structural folds. Functional convergence and functional divergence are revealed by the relationships between protein classification and curated family functions. The taxonomic distribution allows the identification of lineage-specific or broadly conserved protein families and can reveal horizontal gene transfer.

Despite the relatively simple ellipsoidal shape of yeast cells, in the past, cell morphology researchers have processed information on cells manually. These time-consuming, entirely subjective tasks motivated us to develop image-processing software that automatically extracts yeast cells from micrographs and processes them to measure key morphological characteristics such as cell size, roundness, bud neck position angle, nuclear DNA localization and actin localization.
As of August 2004, we have retrieved 1,754,888 cells from 90,696 micrographs of 4,726 mutants using our software, and we have published the results in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Morphological Database (SCMD), which facilitates the analysis of abnormal cells. Our system provides quantitative data for shapes of the daughter and mother cells, localization of the nuclear DNA and morphology of the actin patches. To search for mutants with similar morphological traits, the system outputs a list of mutants ranked by similarity of average morphological parameters. The SCMD is available at http://yeast.gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.","As of August 2004, we have almost finished processing the disruptants of 5,000 non-essential genes. Novel, powerful data mining functions are also provided. With regarding the mutants of about 1,000 essential genes, a way of quantifying their morphological parameters has been recently developed by the Ohya's group. These parameters will be collected and will be available from our site in future.","This research has been partly supported by the Institute for Bioinformatics and Research and Development (BIRD) of the Japan Science and Technology Corporation (JST).

Among these associations, proteinâ€“protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data.

The NIH Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) program is a multi-institutional effort to identify and sequence cDNA clones containing a full-length open reading frame (FL-ORF) for human, mouse, and rat genes. To date, the MGC has produced over 324 cDNA libraries derived from human tissue and cell lines, as well as mouse and rat tissues. The MGC has sequenced and verified the complete FL-ORFs for a non-redundant set of 11,666 human, 10,602 mouse, and 854 rat genes.
Strategy
5' expressed-sequence tags (ESTs) are generated from libraries and analyzed to identify candidate complete ORF clones. These clones are subjected to high accuracy full-insert sequencing and assessed for complete ORFs. Candidate clones for genes are clones that have been identified as potential complete ORFs and are waiting full-insert sequencing. All MGC sequences are deposited in GenBank and available without restriction. The cDNA clones generated by the MGC are available through the IMAGE clone distribution network and are fully accessible to the community.",,,"Strausberg RL, Feingold EA, Klausner RD, Collins FS.

Both automatic and manual curation are performed to combine and interrelate information on genomic and EST sequences, genetic, physical, and sequence-based maps, proteins, molecular markers, mutant phenotypes and QTL, and publications. There are currently nine main search modules within Gramene: Genome Browser, BLAST, CMap, Marker, Protein, Ontology, Mutant, QTL, and Literature. The Genome Browser (http://www.gramene.org/japonica/mapview?chr=1) allows users to view the sequenced rice genome with sequenced features from multiple grass species aligned to it. BLAST (http://www.gramene.org/db/searches/blast) is a local alignment tool that allows users to find the best match to a sequence of interest. CMap (http://www.gramene.org/cmap/), a comparative mapping tool, allows users to view maps from different grass species and to construct comparisons between them. The Marker database (http://www.gramene.org/markers/) allows users to search for markers used for mapping in multiple grass species. The Protein database (http://www.gramene.org/protein/) allows users to find known rice proteins, learn about their functions, and find orthologs from other grasses. The Ontology database (http://www.gramene.org/plant_ontology/) allows users to search the standardized (controlled) vocabularies to find associated genes, proteins and phenotypes. The Mutant database (http://www.gramene.org/rice_mutant/) allows users to find rice genes with known phenotypes. The QTL database (http://www.gramene.org/qtl/) allows users to find quantitative trait loci for multiple grass species such as rice, maize, oat, barley, pearl and foxtail millets and wild rice. The Literature database (http://www.gramene.org/literature/) allows users to search Gramene's collection of curated citations.
Future Plans:Future plans for Gramene include completing the migration to MySQL, the addition of a Diversity module, the addition of new maps and markers for millet in CMap, integration of the Plant Structure (anatomy) ontology from the Plant Ontology Consortium, the addition of phenotypes (QTL and mutants) and proteins from other grass species, updating of the existing data types, the addition of advanced search interfaces, off-site curation tools, and the furthering of outreach activities which will include the development of species specific educational pages and the organization of Research Coordination Network workshops.
The Gramene project is a collaborative effort between Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (http://www.cshl.edu/), the Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics at Cornell University (http://plbrgen.cals.cornell.edu/), and various national and international projects dedicated to cereal genomics and genetics research (see http://www.gramene.org/collaborators/). The database and the datasets are freely available for local use and installation. Quarterly releases provide researchers with current information and tools. For information about the most recent release, view the release notes at http://www.gramene.org/documentation/release_notes/ , and the database statistics at ftp://ftp.gramene.org/pub/gramene/CURRENT_RELEASE/data/statistics/.
Gramene hosts the sequenced genome assembly of rice (Rice-japonica) and Arabidopsis provided by TIGR, in addition to the clone-based map of maize provided by AGI (http://www.genome.arizona.edu/fpc/maize/). Users may browse and search genes, markers, ESTs, cDNAs, clones, etc. on these genomes, as well as sequenced features from, sorghum, Triticeae (wheat, oat and barley), other grasses mapped on rice and maize genomes. See http://www.gramene.org/genome_browser/. The CMap Viewer can be used to search over 160 map sets (each with multiple maps of linkage groups or chromosomes) from 22 species, see http://www.gramene.org/cmap/. Over 4.5 million markers from more than 180 species can be searched to find a marker and get its detailed information on species, source and mapped locations, see http://www.gramene.org/markers/. The database contains over 68,000 protein entries detailing their biochemical characteristics and expression in association with the Gene (GO) and Plant (PO) Ontologies, sequence and cited literature, see http://www.gramene.org/protein/. The database contains about 1,400 genes from rice which have been characterized by phenotype. Among them, 425 genes have been fully annotated with phenotypic descriptions, associations to trait (TO), plant (PO) and gene ontologies (GO), map positions, alleles, phenotypic studies, germplasms, sequences, gene products, and related public references, see http://www.gramene.org/rice_mutant/. Over 9,800 QTL (http://www.gramene.org/qtl/) have been identified for numerous agronomic traits in rice, maize, barley, oat, wheat, pearl millet, foxtail millet and wild rice. The Ontologies link (http://www.gramene.org/plant_ontology/) can be used to find keywords for plant structure, growth stages, traits, function, process, cellular component, environment and taxonomy. The Literature link (http://www.gramene.org/literature/) allows searching for articles about genes, proteins, QTL, markers, or ontologies. Sequence similarity matches can be done using the BLAST link (http://www.gramene.org/Multi/blastview). GrameneMart (http://www.gramene.org/Multi/martview) is a search tool that allows complex searches to filter out large amounts of superfluous data.","Frequent workshops (http://www.gramene.org/outreach/outreach.html), as well as on-line tutorials, FAQ's, help documents (http://www.gramene.org/workshop_tutorial.html) and an active list-serve (http://www.gramene.org/mailarch/) help users with the database and tools.

While Reactome is targeted at human pathways, it also includes many individual biochemical reactions from non-human systems such as rat, mouse, fugu fish and zebra fish. This makes the database relevant to the large number of researchers who work on model organisms. All the information in Reactome is backed up by its provenance: either a literature citation or an electronic inference based on sequence similarity. Our ontology ensures that the various events are linked in an appropriate spatial and temporal context.
The basic information in Reactome is provided by bench biologists who are experts in that domain of biology. The information is then managed and edited by the Reactome staff at CSHL and the EBI, and entered into a relational database. They are then reviewed by other biological researchers for consistency and accuracy. Following peer-review, the information is published to the web.
Reactome supersedes an earlier project called The Genome Knowledgebase and incorporates all the information previously available in its predecessor. Reactome sports a radically redesigned user interface in which the entire set of human pathways known to the database are represented as a series of constellations in a ""starry sky.""

It presents V gene sequences from the EMBL database and Ensembl together with the corresponding links to the source data. The VBASE2 dataset is generated in an automatic process based on a BLAST search of V genes against EMBL and the Ensembl dataset. The BLAST hits are evaluated with the DNAPLOT program, which allows immunoglobulin sequence alignment and comparison, RSS recognition and analysis of the V(D)J-rearrangements. As a result of the BLAST hit evaluation the VBASE2 entries are classified into 3 different classes: class 1 holds sequences for which a genomic reference and a rearranged sequence is known. Class 2 contains sequences which have not been found in a rearrangement, thus lacking evidence of functionality. Class 3 contains sequences which have been found in different V(D)J rearrangements but lack a genomic reference. All VBASE2 sequences are compared with the datasets from the VBASE-, IMGT- and KABAT-databases (latest published versions), and the respective references are provided in each VBASE2 sequence entry. The VBASE2 database can be accessed by either a text based query form or by a sequence alignment with the DNAPLOT program. A DAS-server shows the VBASE2 dataset within the Ensembl Genome Browser and links to the database.","The VBASE2 dataset will be expanded soon. For mouse sequences, strain and haplotype will be assigned. We plan to expand the dataset to T cell receptor V genes and other species.","We are grateful to Rolf Huehne who set up the NGFN-BLAST service, supplying the base of the vbase2 dataset generation procedure.

³Department of Genetics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK",steinbeck@ebi.ac.uk,"Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) is a freely available dictionary of molecular entities focused on Ã¢â‚¬ËœsmallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ chemical compounds. The term Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmolecular entityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ encompasses any constitutionally or isotopically distinct atom, molecule, ion, ion pair, radical, radical ion, complex, conformer, etc., identifiable as a separately distinguishable entity [1]. The molecular entities in question are either natural products or synthetic products used to intervene in the processes of living organisms. Genome-encoded macromolecules (nucleic acids, proteins and peptides derived from proteins by cleavage) are not as a rule included in ChEBI. In addition to molecular entities, ChEBI contains groups (parts of molecular entities) and classes of entities. ChEBI encompasses an ontological classification, whereby the relationships between molecular entities or classes of entities and their parents and/or children are specified. ChEBI uses nomenclature, symbolism and terminology endorsed by the following international scientific bodies:- International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (http://www.iupac.org/) (IUPAC)
- Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (http://www.iubmb.org/) (NC-IUBMB)
All data in the database is non-proprietary or is derived from a non-proprietary source. Each data item is fully traceable and explicitly referenced to the original source.
ChEBI shows the following data fields:- ChEBI identifer - the unique identifer
- ChEBI name - the name recommended for use in biological databases
- ChEBI ASCII name - the ChEBI name with any special characters rendered in ASCII format
- Definition - a short verbal definition is included in some entries, especially relevant to classes
- Structure - graphical representation(s) of a molecular structure and associated molfile(s), IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) and SMILES strings
- Formula - Molecular formula
- Parents and children, according to ChEBI Ontology
- IUPAC name - a name generated according to the recommendations of IUPAC
- Synonyms - other names together with an indication of their source
- Database links - manually curated cross-references to other non-proprietary databases
- Registry numbers - CAS Registry Number, Beilstein Registry Number, Gmelin Registry Number (if available)
- Comment(s) - A free-text comment may be added to some terms, especially in cases where confusing terminology has been historically used. A comment may relate to a single term or to the entry as a whole.
The ChEBI terms have been automatically mapped to the UniProt (http://www.ebi.uniprot.org/) database, and for each ChEBI entity the list of UniProt entries containing the relevant terms are available. ChEBI can be accessed through the WWW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/) or may be downloaded by anonymous FTP (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chebi/).","Structures: ChEBI stores two- or three-dimensional structural diagrams as connection tables in MDL molfile format. One entity can have one or more connection tables. The diagrams are shown as the static images or can be visualised with an interactive MarvinView applet (http://www.chemaxon.com/marvin/). The IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI?; http://www.iupac.org/inchi/) and SMILES (http://www.daylight.com/smiles/) strings are generated for the corresponding molecules.
ChEBI Ontology consists of four sub-ontologies:
- Molecular Structure, in which molecular entities or parts thereof are classified according to structure;
- Biological Role, which classifies entities on the basis of their role within a biological context (e.g. antibiotic, coenzyme, hormone);
- Application, which classifies entities, where appropriate, on the basis of their intended use by humans (e.g. pesticide, drug, fuel);
- Subatomic Particle, which classifies particles smaller than atoms.
The ontology uses the following relationship types:
is a
is part of
is conjugate acid of and is conjugate base of
is tautomer of
is enantiomer of
has functional parent
has parent hydride
is substituent group from
Web Services: the main aim of ChEBI Web Services (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/webServices.do) is to provide programmatic access to the ChEBI database in order to aid our users in integrating ChEBI into their applications. ChEBI provides Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) access to its database. Both Java and perl clients are available through which you can access the data.To obtain Ã¢â‚¬ËœlightweightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ontology objects, the Ontology Lookup Service (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/) [2] can be used as alternative Web Services.
SourceForge forum (http://sourceforge.net/projects/chebi/) has been established and is used to report bugs, discuss annotation issues and to request the new ChEBI terms or entries.

The motifs and scoring matrices derived from such conserved regions provide computational tools to recognize similar patterns in novel sequences, and thus enable protein function prediction for genomes. The eBLOCKs database enumerates a cascade of protein blocks with varied conservation levels for each functional domain. A biologically important region is most stringently conserved among a smaller family of highly similar proteins. The same region is often found in a larger group of more remotely related proteins with a reduced stringency. Through enumeration, highly specific signatures can be generated from blocks with more columns and fewer family members, while highly sensitive signatures can be derived from blocks with fewer columns and more members as in a super-family. By applying PSI-BLAST and a modified K-means clustering algorithm, eBLOCKs automatically groups protein sequences according to different levels of similarity. Multiple sequence alignments are made and trimmed into a series of ungapped blocks. Motifs and position specific scoring matrices were derived from eBLOCKs and made available for sequence search and annotation. The eBLOCKs database provides a tool for high throughput genome annotation with maximal specificity and sensitivity.

GabiPD constitutes a repository and analysis platform for a wide array of heterogeneous data from high-throughput experiments in several plant species. Data from different 'omics' fronts are incorporated (i.e. genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics), originating from 14 different model or crop species. We have developed the concept of GreenCards for text-based retrieval of all data types in GabiPD (e.g., clones, genes, mutant lines). All data types point to a central Gene GreenCard, where gene information is integrated from genome projects or NCBI UniGene sets. The centralised Gene GreenCard allows the visualization of ESTs aligned to annotated transcripts as well as the display of identified protein domains and gene structure. Moreover GabiPD makes available interactive genetic maps from potato and barley, and 2DE-gels from Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus.

The dataset of human genes in GenAge has been continually improved in terms of data quality, while it has also grown slightly. The set of genes associated with longevity in model organisms has seen an increase of more than 2 fold, while the structure of the database has also been updated to accommodate new features. Now, this section hosts for each longevity-associated gene multiple observations from the same or different studies, and more quantitative data on the impact (relative change) that a certain genetic intervention has on lifespan. Genes have also been classified as pro-longevity, anti-longevity or necessary to fitness. The GenDR database, which has been previously described elsewhere (3), is now fully integrated in HAGR with abundant cross-links to the other HAGR resources. Although in terms of content AnAge has grown only slightly, we have consistently continued to curate its data and enhance its quality, in line with defined standards and procedures (4). Additionally, new information and references have also been added to some of the AnAge entries.

IPD currently consists of four databases: IPD-KIR, contains the allelic sequences of Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors, IPD-MHC, is a database of sequences of the major histocompatibility complex of different species; IPD-HPA, alloantigens expressed only on platelets; and IPD-ESTAB, which provides access to the European Searchable Tumour Cell-Line Database, a cell bank of immunologically characterised melanoma cell lines.
The MHC sequences of many different species have been reported, along with different nomenclature systems used in the naming and identification of new genes and alleles in each species. The sequences of the major histocompatibility complex from number of different species are highly conserved between species. By bringing the work of different nomenclature committees and the sequences of different species together it is hoped to provide a central resource that will facilitate further research on the MHC of each species and on their comparison.
The first release of the IPD-MHC database involved the work of groups specialising in non-human primates, canines (DLA) and felines (FLA) and incorporated all data previously available in the IMGT/MHC database. This release included data from five species of ape, sixteen species of new world monkey, seventeen species of old world monkey, as well as data on different canines and felines. Since the first release we have been able to add sequences from cattle (BoLA), swine (SLA), and rats (RT1) and are now working to include the MHC sequences from chickens, horses (ELA).",,"P Stoehr, European Bioinformatics Institute, UK

Human platelet antigens are alloantigens expressed only on platelets, specifically on platelet membrane glycoproteins. These platelet-specific antigens are immunogenic and can result in pathological reactions to transfusion therapy. The Human Platelet Antigen (HPA) nomenclature system was adopted in 1990 to overcome problems with the previous nomenclature. Since then more antigens have been described and the molecular basis of many has been resolved. As a result the nomenclature was revised in 2003 and included in the IPD project. The IPD-HPA section contains nomenclature information and additional background material. The different genes in the HPA system have not been sequenced to the same level as some of the other projects and so currently only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are used to determine alleles.

The Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR) are members of the immunoglobulin super family (IgSF) formerly called Killer-cell Inhibitory Receptors. KIRs have been shown to be highly polymorphic both at the allelic and haplotypic levels. They are composed of two or three Ig-domains, a transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail, which can in turn be short (activatory) or long (inhibitory). The Leukocyte Receptor Complex (LRC), which encodes KIR genes, has been shown to be polymorphic, polygenic and complex in a manner similar to the MHC. This complexity in sequences has lead to the formation of the KIR nomenclature committee. The nomenclature committee is responsible for the naming of new allele sequences and produced its first report in 2002; this was complemented by the inclusion of the KIR data into IPD. The IPD-KIR Sequence Database contains the most up to date nomenclature and sequence alignments. Also available is an online submission tool that allows the submission of new and confirmatory KIR sequences directly to the KIR nomenclature committee. Future developments of the IPD-KIR section will involve working with the KIR nomenclature committee to provide nomenclature and tools for study of the complex haplotypes and genotypes currently seen in KIR research.",,"P Stoehr, European Bioinformatics Institute, UK

As more genomes of gamma-proteobacteria are being sequenced, the prediction of these elements in a growing number of organisms has become more feasible, as a step towards the study of how different bacteria respond to environmental changes at the level of transcriptional regulation. In this work we present TRACTOR_DB (TRAnscription FaCTORsÿ predicted sites in prokaryotic genomes), a relational database that contains computational predictions of new members of 74 regulons in eight gamma-proteobacterial genomes. To produce these predictions we used a comparative genomics approach of which several proof-of-principle articles for large regulons have been published. Furthermore, we used the predictions stored in our database to assess the conservation of regulons' size across all the eight genomes and showed that a correlation exists between the conservation of a regulatory site and the structure of the Transcription Unit (TU) it regulates.

Identifying the optimal refolding conditions and methodology is therefore rate limiting. In order to address this problem, we have catalogued the methods employed in the refolding of proteins in a web-accessible relational database, REFOLD. Entries are heavily annotated such that the database can be searched via multiple parameters. The database will have two roles: First, as a data repository and experimental resource, new data can be rapidly deposited, validated and made available to the refolding and wider scientific community. Much valuable refolding data goes unpublished (for example, in cases where a protein cannot be refolded for structural studies), thus we aim to exploit this untapped resource by encouraging deposition in REFOLD. The database will thus become a powerful experimental tool for the optimization of protein expression, refolding and purification, bypassing the relatively slow and inefficient examination of the literature. Second, REFOLD will become a valuable resource for theoreticians looking for relationships between refolding success and protein characteristics such as charge and hydrophobicity.

We have developed a web-based integrated database on cell cycle regulation in mammals in normal and pathological states (Cyclonet database, http://cyclonet.biouml.org/). It integrates data obtained by ""omics"" sciences and chemoinformatics on the basis of systems biology approach. Cyclonet is a specialized resource, which enables researchers working in the field of anticancer drug discovery to analyze the wealth of currently available information in a systematic way. Cyclonet contains information on relevant genes and molecules; diagrams and models of cell cycle regulation and results of their simulation; microarray data on cell cycle and on various types of cancer, information on drug targets and their ligands, as well as extensive bibliography on modelling of cell cycle and cancer related gene expression data. Cyclonet database is also accessible through BioUML workbench, which allows flexible querying, analyzing and editing the data by means of visual modelling. Cyclonet aims to predict promising anticancer targets and their agents by application of PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances).
The main goal of the Cyclonet database is to integrate information from genomics, proteomics, chemoinformatics and systems biology on mammalian cell cycle regulation in normal and pathological states. This will help molecular biologists working in the field of anticancer drug development to analyze systematically all these data and generate experimentally testable hypothesis.
Cyclonet incorporates data on various carcinogenesis related topics, such as: cell cycle control in mammals, cell survival programs (e.g., NF-κB pathway), regulation of nucleosome compactisation and chromatin remodelling in cell cycle, DNA methylation and other epigenetic mechanisms of cell growth and differentiation. Biological pathways, computer models of cell cycle, microarray data coming from studies of cell cycle and analysis of cancer-related materials are also systematically collected in this database [1].
Cyclonet supports discovery of novel drug targets and development of effective anticancer therapies by collecting all available data related to the control of cell cycle in normal and pathological states and providing a system biology platform for knowledge-based anticancer drug discovery.
Novel software technologies were used for the database development:
-BioUML workbench (http://www.biouml.org, [2]) was used for formal description and visual modelling of biological pathways and processes related to the cell cycle regulation and cancer. It also allows to simulate the described systems behaviour using Java or MATLAB simulation engines;
-BeanExplorer Enterprise Edition (http://www.beanexplorer.com) was used to develop web interface for Cyclonet database.","Now we are developing a set of plug-ins in BioUML workbench for visual modelling of integration between the biological pathways and microarray data that will provide: coloring of diagrams for biological pathways to display data on gene expression levels, reconstruction of gene networks and fitting the model parameters in accordance with the microarray data.

The current version of the database, human v2, contains 386 000 motifs with lengths between 6 to ~30 base pairs. Motifs were predicted for ~18 000 human genes, using sequence search regions that extended from 1.5 Kb upstream to 200b downstream of a transcription start site, net of most types of repeats and of coding exons, which were masked. Many known transcription factor binding sites are located in such regions. Motifs were predicted using multiple de novo discovery methods applied to multi-species sequence sets that contained between 4 and 15 vertebrate species. An empirical p-value was assigned to each motif by applying motif discovery methods to randomized sequence sets that were adaptively derived from target sequence sets, and retaining motifs below a p-value threshold. Groups of similar motifs were identified using OPTICS hierarchical clustering; co-occurring patterns of motifs are being identified. Predicted regulatory elements can be viewed directly in cisRED's web user interface, and can be user-filtered by p-value or species composition. In addition, motifs can be viewed in the UCSC or Ensembl genome browsers, and in the Sockeye comparative genomics workspace. Methods are described by documentation on the cisRED web site.

Raw data from duplicate genome sets are collected along with phenotype and ""hit"" information. The scientists have password-protected accounts which give them access to data entry interfaces and direct links to their personal data, both published and unpublished. The logged in user also has access to some tools for viewing data a plate at a time, direct links to the bioinformatic tools (listed below), and functions for directly querying the quality control (QC) information for the source plates.
Website Overview The public database begins with a page listing all published screens that have been done at the DRSC. From there, the experimental data for each assay may be viewed in a configurable table. Where possible, links to the published papers and supplementary data are also provided. Also on the starting page are links to various informatic tools, a gene lookup function which provides extensive amplicon data, and a list of completed, but not yet published, screens.",,"The authors would like to thank Carolyn Shamu and Tim Mitchison of The Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology (ICCB) at Harvard Medical School and Erik Brauner of the Broad Institute for all their help and guidance in setting up the early phase of the DRSC database.

GLIDA is a novel public GPCR-related chemical genomic database that is primarily focused on the correlation of information between GPCRs and their ligands. It provides correlation data between GPCRs and their ligands, along with chemical information on the ligands, as well as access information to the various web databases regarding GPCRs. These data are connected with each other in a relational database, allowing users in the field of GPCR-related drug discovery to easily retrieve such information from either biological or chemical starting points. GLIDA includes structure similarity search functions for the GPCRs and for their ligands. Thus, GLIDA can provide correlation maps linking the searched homologous GPCRs (or ligands) with their ligands (or GPCRs). By analyzing the correlation patterns between GPCRs and ligands, we can gain more detailed knowledge about their interactions and improve drug design efforts by focusing on inferred candidates for GPCR-specific drugs.

IMOTdb is a repertoire of spatially interacting motifs in single protein structures as well as those among distantly related protein structures that belong to a superfamily. iMotdb pertains to 854 488 motifs of 60 849 protein structural domains corresponding to SCOP 1.67 database. For each structural member in the superfamily that has been considered in SCOP database, homologous sequences are individually identified. Alignment positions are provided an average similarity score after consulting amino acid exchange matrix. Contiguous residues with an average similarity score of more than 50 are treated as conserved residues or motifs. These motifs are mapped on to the structural superfamily member to examine their spatial proximity with each other. Pairs of conserved residues are further examined by calculating psuedoenergies that describe the strength of interactions. Spatially interacting motifs are mapped on to the alignment of the superfamily to further recognize spatially interacting motifs that are conserved throughout the superfamily. Interactive three-dimensional display of the motifs on the structure is provided for better understanding and visualization. Structural information about individual motifs is provided that includes the presence of motifs in secondary structures, solvent accessibility patterns and positional variations amongst superfamily members (reflected as root mean square deviations). Spatially interacting motifs can be critical for structure and/or function. They are useful in searching for distant homologues and establishing remote homologies among the largely unassigned sequences in genome databases. Availability of information on structural motifs in large number of protein structures should be useful as starting points to perform detailed analysis, for the rational design of experiments in protein folding, site-directed mutagenesis and to understand mechanism of action and conformational changes in proteins. iMOTdb database can be accessed from http://caps.ncbs.res.in/imotdb/.",,,,Structure Databases,Protein structure,Metabolic and Signaling Pathways,Protein-protein interactions,,,

The data has been formalized to a higher extent, resulting in development of an ontology for modified bases, and flat file parsers that make the data more accessible for batch download and further analyses.","We would like to thank Rich Roberts, Stephen Douthwaite, Adrian Ferre D'Amare, Jef Rozenski, Saulius Klimasauskas, Xiaodong Cheng, and Tim Bestor for their contribution and intense discussion of the modification and enzyme nomenclature system.

A PSSM is generated with respect to one of the sequences involved in the multiple sequence alignment as a reference. We have shown earlier that use of multiple PSSMs corresponding to an alignment, with several sequences in the family used as reference, improves the sensitivity of the remote homology detection dramatically [1,2]. MulPSSM contains PSSMs for a large number of sequence and structural families of protein domains with multiple PSSMs for every family [3]. The approach involves use of a clustering algorithm to identify most distinct sequences corresponding to a family. With each one of the distinct sequences as reference, multiple PSSMs have been generated.","The current release of MulPSSM contains 403,107 PSSMs corresponding to 14, 831 sequence based families from Pfam (version 27.0) and 14235 PSSMs corresponding to 3856 structural families in PALI database [5] corresponding to SCOP (Version 1.75). An RPS-BLAST [6,7] interface allows sequence search against PSSMs of sequence or structural families or both. The data has been presented using dynamic HTML. There is also an option to obtain the results of the RPS-BLAST as a dendrogram. Such a dendrogram will enable the users in better understanding of the relationship amongst the query and the various hits, along with an ease with which users can identify closely and remotely related hits to the query. An analysis interface allows display and convenient navigation of alignments and domain hits.","This work is supported by Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi.","1.

NPInter intends to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive and integrated tool for efficient browsing and extraction of information on interactions between ncRNAs and protein related biomacromolecules (PRMs). Beyond cataloguing details of these interactions, the NPInter will be useful for understanding ncRNA function, as it adds a very important functional element Ã¢â‚¬â€œ noncoding RNAs - to the biomolecule interaction network and sets up a bridge between the coding and the noncoding kingdoms.
By functional interactions we mean both physical interactions between an ncRNA and a protein, and other forms of interaction where the combination of an ncRNA and an mRNA or a genomic DNA sequence elicits a cellular reaction. Although biological knowledge on this sort of interactions is contained in the scientific literature, retrieving it will be much easier with the NPInter database.
The database now contains 700 published functional interactions from six model organisms - Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens.

This exceptional genotypic diversity underlies the phenotypic diversity maize needs to be cultivated in a wide range of environments. The Molecular and Functional Diversity in the Maize Genome project aims to understand how selection has shaped molecular diversity in maize and then relate molecular diversity to functional phenotypic variation. The project will screen 4000 loci for the signature of selection and create a wide range of maize and maize-teosinte mapping populations.

Therefore a rich collection of methods in computational biology relies on the analysis and comparison of protein sequences. Many of these intensively used methods perform sequence similarity searches (e.g. BLAST (1)) or compare protein sequences against secondary databases of protein families (e.g. InterPro (2)).
The rapidly increasing volume of publicly available protein sequences forges a computational dilemma for bioinformatics tasks that require repeated all-against-all calculations of sequence similarities or sequence features. Such rather straightforward but technically challenging tasks among others are the annotation of genomes or the clustering of the protein sequence space into protein families. The Similarity Matrix of Proteins (SIMAP) solves the computational dilemma described above by incrementally pre-calculating the sequence similarities forming the known protein sequence space (3). The comparison of new sequences vs. known ones returns symmetric scores that can be updated accordingly in the existing records. To complement the pair-wise sequence similarity matrix by position specific searches against known protein families, SIMAP in addition pre-calculates sequence based features as e.g. InterPro matches (2).
The SIMAP database provides a comprehensive and up-to-date pre-calculation of the protein sequence similarity matrix, sequence-based features and sequence clusters. As of September 2009, SIMAP covers 48 million proteins and more than 23 million non-redundant sequences.
Access to SIMAP is freely provided through the web portal for individuals (http://mips.gsf.de/simap/) and for programmatic access through DAS (http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/das/) and Web-Service (http://mips.gsf.de/webservices/services/SimapService2.0?wsdl).","Novel features of SIMAP include the expansion of the sequence space by including databases such as ENSEMBL as well as the integration of metagenomes based on their consistent processing and annotation. Furthermore, protein function predictions by Blast2GO are pre-calculated for all sequences in SIMAP and the data access and query functions have been improved. SIMAP assists biologists to query the up-to-date sequence space systematically and facilitates large-scale downstream projects in computational biology.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the BOINCSIMAP community for donating their CPU power for the calculation of protein similarities and features.

Industrially relevant applications range from food science to laundry. We have now released MACiE, an electronic database of well-characterised enzymatic reactions. MACiE is the result of more than three years' collaboration between the Mitchell and Murray-Rust groups in the Unilever Centre and Prof. Janet Thornton at the European Bioinformatics Institute. The database contains the reaction mechanisms for 100 individual enzymes; this includes the overall reactions and the multiple steps that constitute them. We hold the data in CMLReact, a novel XML application. We are developing software for classifying enzymes in a manner complementary to the existing EC (Enzyme Commission) scheme, which has been the state-of-the-art since the 1960's.
MACiE (Mechanism, Annotation and Classification in Enzymes) is available at http://www-mitchell.ch.cam.ac.uk/macie/. Version 1 of MACiE consists of a non-homologous dataset of enzymes with known structure. 100 overall reaction mechanisms comprising 358 reaction steps are included. The MACiE website contains images of every reaction step, showing each starting material, intermediate and product. Annotations describe the part each amino acid plays in each reaction step, as well as listing the mechanistic attributes. Most of the reactions can also be viewed as animations. It is even possible interactively to browse MACiE's chemical space as a HyperGraph projection using a Java applet.
Our preliminary analysis has enabled us to draw some conclusions about the roles played by the different amino acid residues in enzyme catalysis. Amino acids with alkyl or aryl side-chains have been shown to act mainly as main-chain spectators. In contrast, amino acids with side-chain chemical functionality rarely act through their main-chains. A study of the mechanisms of the 358 distinct reaction steps in MACiE reveals that amino acids accomplish nearly all their chemistry through simple acid/base catalysis - 236 of these steps are proton transfers. Nonetheless, a significant variety of mechanisms are used, including some, such as the Claisen condensation, Claisen rearrangement, Amadori rearrangement and aldol condensation, familiar from in vitro organic chemistry, and 26 steps involve radical chemistry.
Following a major revision of the annotation used in MACiE we have now a consistent way to describe the chemistry performed by enzymes in each step of the reactions they catalyse. This allows us to address classification in enzymes in a way different to that established by the EC. Whereas the latter classification considers only the overall reaction catalysed, ours is based on the mechanistic approaches undertaken by the different enzymes to perform their functions. Enzymes that catalyse completely different overall reactions can share a very similar catalytic site, and therefore the mechanism used to transform substrates into products can be similar. On the other hand, diverse enzymes can catalyse the same overall reaction by quite different sequences of steps, as we find with four distinct classes of beta lactamases. With the detailed knowledge about reaction mechanisms we have nowadays, this new approach to classifying enzymes seems a natural evolution of the traditional classification methods. Finally, amino acids that bind the substrate but play no direct catalytic role will be considered in future versions of MACiE and some interesting results are expected in this area.",,,"1.

RNR is an enzyme that uses radical chemistry to reduce ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. Since this is the only pathway for the de novo synthesis of DNA building blocks, the activity of RNR is essential in all dividing cells, and RNR genes are found in virtually every organism including numerous viruses. RNRs are classified into three main groups (class I, class II and class III) according to reaction mechanism, cofactor requirements (tyrosyl radical, dexoyadenosylcobalamin, or S-adenosylmethionine/glycyl radical) and quaternary structure (Α, Α₂ or Α₂Β₂). In addition substrate specificity (ribonucleoside diphosphates or ribonucleoside triphosphates) and amino acid sequences differ between the classes. Despite these extensive differences the common three-dimensional structure of the Α-components of all three classes clearly points to a common evolutionary origin for all RNRs. RNRdb contains curated RNR sequence data including genomic and species data, a compilation of all published 3D structures of different RNR proteins, and a compilation of all mutant proteins constructed including links to the relevant publication(s). Users can easily retrieve RNR protein sequences that have been either experimentally characterised or predicted from genome sequence data for any given organism, or search the database for occurrence of RNR classes in taxonomic groups. A BLAST server allows sequences to be BLASTed against all sequences in RNRdb and results can be retreived in FASTA format.

The CCDS set is calculated after a coordinated whole-genome annotation update by the collaborating annotation groups: NCBI, EBI, and WTSI. The CCDS set includes only those protein coding annotations that precisely agree in every exon placement across the entire coding region. UCSC provides independent and intensive quality control procedures augmented by work from the other groups. Once a coding gene structure is agreed, it will be maintained for future releases unless there is good evidence to modify or remove it. The collaboration has improved independent annotation methods (both computational analysis and manual annotation) and we expect continued growth in the CCDS set as more gene structures and more organisms are included in the collection.
The long-term goal of the CCDS project is to converge toward a full set of standard gene annotations for finished high-quality genomes. We anticipate that through continued manual review, experimental validation of weakly supported genes, and as automatic annotation methods continue to improve, the CCDS set will become more complete.
The CCDS web site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/) provides information about CCDS and sequence identifiers, the CDS data as both coordinates and sequence, and links to genome browsers.

The GENSAT project seeks to map the expression of all genes expressed in mouse brain at four different developmental ages - embryonic days 10.5 and 15.5, post-natal day 7, and adult.
The GENSAT project has mapped 2,148 genes to date. The data are available at NCBI in the form of a searchable image database. Images from the Rockefeller University data set include both confocal and brightfield images at very high resolutions, demonstrating expression at the resolution of cell bodies and processes; images from the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital set include high-throughput in situ hybridization images. All images are browseable in their original unmodified form, as well as several levels of resolution designed to aid interactivity. In addition, the images from Rockefeller University have a searchable set of human-curated annotations remarking expression levels and patterns in a wide variety of anatomical structures.

Though the sequence itself is not the key for many currently unanswered questions related to human diseases, it sheds light on potential genetic solution of these diseases. We believe that the available annotations including physical characterization and functional protein domains of known tumor-related genes can be used to study the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. The tumor-associated gene (TAG; http://www.binfo.ncku.edu.tw/TAG) database was designed to utilize information from well-characterized oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes to facilitate cancer research. All target genes were identified through text-mining approach from the PubMed database. A semi-automatic information retrieving engine was built to collect specific information of these target genes from various resources and store in the TAG database. The information are arranged into five tables including Ã‚Â¡Ã‚Â§Gene contentÃ‚Â¡Ã‚Â¨, Ã‚Â¡Ã‚Â§Protein domain/familyÃ‚Â¡Ã‚Â¨, Ã‚Â¡Ã‚Â§Gene OntologyÃ‚Â¡Ã‚Â¨, Ã‚Â¡Ã‚Â§Disorder & MutationÃ‚Â¡Ã‚Â¨, and Ã‚Â¡Ã‚Â§Cross referenceÃ‚Â¡Ã‚Â¨.

In addition, 151 genes that are known to be involved in oncogenesis but the genes actions have not been classified were also collected in the TAG database. We have designed user-friendly web interfaces that provide functions in searching and analysis of TAG information. Furthermore, we categorized all TAG domains and generate a weight matrix table to provide additional analysis in ""oncogenic potential"" for any customer-provided protein. The TAG is an integrated database that collected only well studied gene in related to oncogenesis. Beside to provide comprehensive information of well-known tumor-related genes to promote biomedical studies, our final goal is to identify novel TAG and study their role in tumorigenesis using a more systemic approach.",,"This study was supported by grant of National research program for genomic medicine (NRPGM) from National Science Council, Taiwan",,Human Genes and Diseases,Cancer gene databases,,,,,

The family is divided into group I (CPN60, also known as Hsp60 or GroEL, found in bacteria, some archaea, mitochondria and plastids) and group II (CCT or TriC, found in archaea and the eukaryotic cytoplasm). Chaperonin sequences are useful for phylogenetic studies and have been widely exploited in studies of prokaryotic and eukaryotic evolution since they are often more informative than 16S rRNA sequences, especially for closely related organisms. Group I chaperonin sequences have also been employed as targets for detection and identification of organisms since a 549-567 bp segment of the cpn60 coding region, the ""universal target"", can be amplified with universal PCR primers. The discriminating power of cpn60 makes it an attractive target for species-specific and quantitative sequence-based diagnostics. cpnDB is a curated collection of chaperonin sequence data collected from public databases or generated by a network of collaborators exploiting the cpn60 target in clinical, phylogenetic, and microbial ecology studies. The database contains all available sequences for group I and group II chaperonins and the contents are updated weekly.

We have developed the CancerGenes resource to simplify the process of gene selection and prioritization in large collaborative projects. CancerGenes combines gene lists annotated by experts with information from key public databases. Each gene is annotated with gene name(s), functional description, organism, chromosome number, location, Entrez Gene ID, GO terms, InterPro descriptions, gene structure, protein length, transcript count, and experimentally determined transcript control regions, as well as links to Entrez Gene, COSMIC, and iHOP gene pages and the UCSC and Ensembl genome browsers. The user-friendly interface provides for searching, sorting and intersection of gene lists. Users may view tabulated results through a web browser or may dynamically download them as a spreadsheet table.",,"We gratefully acknowledge the efforts of Marc Ladanyi and Doron Betel in the critical review of a preliminary implementation of CancerGenes and their helpful suggestions.

To map the human interactome, several strategies have recently been pursued. The generated interaction datasets are valuable resources for scientists in biology and medicine. However, comparison reveals limited overlap between different interaction networks. This divergence obstructs usability, as researchers have to interrogate numerous heterogeneous datasets to identify potential interaction partners for proteins of interest. To facilitate direct access through a single entry gate, we have started to integrate currently available human protein interaction data in an easily accessible online database, called UniHI (Unified Human Interactome).
UniHI provides researchers with a flexible integrated tool for the exploration of the human interactome. It enables the assembly of comprehensive lists of protein interactions and flexible network-orientated searching. Network structures can be identified which would not be detectable if single maps were analyzed separately. For highly targeted search, UniHI offers several tools to specify the displayed interactions. Also, scores for quality assessment are given based on co-annotation and co-expression of the interacting proteins. Various hyperlinks to other databases facilitate users to follow-up results retrieved in UniHI.","Since its first release, UniHI has considerably increased in size. The latest update of UniHI (version 4) includes over 250,000 interactions between ~22,300 unique proteins collected from 14 major PPI sources. However, this wealth of data also poses new challenges for researchers due to the complexity of interaction networks retrieved from the database. We therefore developed several new tools to query, analyze and visualize human PPI networks.
While the former versions of UniHI only provided non-interactive display, the present update includes interactive graphical tools which offer many attractive features for rapid analysis and adjustment of the extracted information. Most importantly, UniHI allows now the focused querying of canonical pathways and construction of tissue-specific interaction networks: The UniHI Pathway Scanner provides the possibility to examine the intersection of canonical pathways from KEGG with the extracted networks. In this way, it enables researchers to detect possible modifiers of pathways as well as proteins involved in the cross-talk between different pathways. An additional new tool termed UniHI Express allows the filtering of PPIs based on gene expression in selected tissues and thus enables the construction of tissue-specific networks and represents a first step towards a dynamic representation of the human interactome.
UniHI will continue to extend its scope by the incorporation of newly available PPI resources and to consolidate the frequently divergent data. In this context, we like to invite other data providers and researchers to participate in the UniHI project.","We would like to acknowledge the support of the German BMBF (NGFN2, KB-P04T03, 01GR0471) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) by the SFB 618 grant.","1.

Database records include the population and ethnic group, the disorder name and the related gene, accompanied by links to any corresponding locus-specific mutation database, to the respective Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man entries and the mutation together with its frequency in that population. The initial information is derived from the published literature, locus-specific databases and genetic disease consortia. FINDbase offers a user-friendly query interface, providing instant access to the list and frequencies of the different mutations. Query outputs can be either in a table or graphical format, accompanied by reference(s) on the data source. Registered users from three different groups, namely administrator, national coordinator and curator, are responsible for database curation and/or data entry/correction online via a password-protected interface. Database access is free of charge and there are no registration requirements for data querying.

Intermediate filaments are part of the cytoskeleton, the flexible scaffold of polymeric filaments in the cytoplasm that is essential for structural integrity of the cell. Intermediate filament proteins are encoded by a large multigene family with an estimated 70 genes in the human genome plus a small number of alternatively spliced transcripts. Six classes of intermediate filament have been described, the two largest of which are the keratins (type I and type II intermediate filaments).
Since 1991, variations in 20 different epithelial keratin genes have been shown to cause of a variety of human diseases in epidermal and epithelial structures. The number of published variants within the keratins alone is now in excess of 696 and combined with the pathogenic variants that are emerging in the other members of the intermediate filament gene superfamily, this shows the growing need for a readily accessible database of intermediate filament variants. In accordance with the aims of the HUGO Human Genome Variation Society, the Human Intermediate Filament Database has been established to address this need.",,,,Protein sequence databases,Protein localization and targeting,Human Genes and Diseases,"Gene-, system- or disease-specific databases",,,

The database was updated from our previously developed database of MiCroKit 3.0 (1), which contained 1,489 proteins mostly forming super-complexes at midbody, centrosome and kinetochore from seven eukaryotes. Since the telomere and spindle apparatus are critical for cell division, the proteins localized at the two positions were also integrated. From the scientific literature, we curated 1,872 experimentally identified proteins which at least locate in one of the five positions from eight species. Then the ortholog detection was performed to identify potential MiCroKiTS proteins from 144 eukaryotic organisms, which contains 66, 45 and 33 species of animals, fungi and plants, respectively. In total, 87,983 unique proteins with corresponding localization information were integrated into the database (2).

This knowledge environment includes freely available data derived from small molecules and small-molecule screens, and resources for studying the data such that biological and medical insights can be gained from their results. ChemBank is intended to guide chemists synthesizing novel compounds or libraries, to assist biologists searching for small molecules that perturb specific biological processes, and to catalyze the process by which new and effective medicines are discovered.
ChemBank stores an increasingly varied set of cell measurements derived from various biological objects, including cell lines treated with small molecules. Analysis tools are available and are being developed that allow the relationships between cell states, cell measurements, and small molecules to be determined. Small molecules contained with ChemBank are manually annotated with biological activities from the primary literature using both internal and publicly available controlled vocabularies such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and the Gene Ontology (GO). Currently, ChemBank stores information on hundreds of thousands of small molecules and hundreds of biomedically relevant assays that have been performed at the ICG in collaborations involving biomedical researchers worldwide. These scientists have agreed to perform their experiments in an open data-sharing environment.
The primary goal of ChemBank is to provide life scientists unfettered access to biomedically relevant data and tools heretofore available almost exclusively in the private sector. ChemBank is intended to be a planning and discovery tool for chemists and biologists, as well as those interested in finding new therapeutic drugs. In sum, ChemBank is an evolving knowledge environment that can be freely used to extract knowledge from public experiments whose greatest value is likely to reside in their collective sum.","For recent developments in ChemBank, please see the Release Notes (http://chembank.broadinstitute.org/details.htm?tag=ReleaseNotes).","ChemBank has been funded in large part with federal funds from the National Cancer InstituteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Initiative for Chemical Genetics, National Institutes of Health, under Contract No. N01-CO-12400.

This leads to a dramatic increase in the number of predicted protein sequences, which serve as a starting point for structural, functional and phylogenomic studies. In such studies, high-throughput comparative analyses are often required to transfer information between organisms, for which the concept of orthology is crucial. The original definition by Fitch describes orthologs as genes that diverged through a speciation event, as opposed to paralogs, which diverged after a duplication event (1). eggNOG, namely evolutionary genealogy of genes Non-supervised Orthologous Groups, is a database providing clusters of orthologous groups for a vast majority of genes covered by the whole tree of life. The database contains a hierarchy of orthologous groups to balance phylogenetic coverage and resolution, and provides automatic function annotation.","In the following text, the new features of eggnog v2 are presented. Our procedure (2) has been applied to 630 complete genomes (529 bacteria, 46 archaea and 55 eukaryotes), which is a twofold increase relative to the previous version. The pipeline yielded 224,847 orthologous groups (OGs) including 9,724 extended versions of the original COG and KOG. Altogether, the protein dataset covers 2,590,259 proteins of which 2,242,035 (87%) were included in at least one of 224,847 orthologous groups generated by eggNOG.
To provide a higher resolution of orthologous groups in frequently used taxonomic groupings, we applied our procedure to several subsets of organisms separately. We updated the previously computed more fine-grained NOGs at the level of fungi (fuNOGs), metazoans (meNOGs), insects (inNOGs), vertebrates (veNOGs) and mammals (maNOGs) and added groups for archaea (arNOGs), fishes (fiNOGs), rodents (roNOGs) and primates (prNOGs). An important feature of eggNOG is the functional annotations of the orthologous groups. Our original pipeline, providing functional descriptions for the non-supervised orthologous groups (NOGs), is now complemented by an automatic inference of functional categories (FCs) which were taken from the COG database (3). The 25 FCs available from the COG resource have been widely used to assess comparative genomics studies and will enable higher order analyses of OGs identified in any dataset.
To facilitate the in-depth analysis of the orthologous relationships within the groups of proteins, we now provide pre-computed high quality Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) and maximum likelihood trees via the web interface.",,"1.

The advent of the sequencing era has resulted in an exponential increase in the number of fully sequenced genomes. This, coupled with the improvements in tree reconstruction algorithms, have made phylome construction a tool used more and more often for the analysis of genomes. Reconstructing a phylome implies the generation of large amounts of data in the form of multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees. PhylomeDB was first created to serve as storage to all this data, where users could not only download whole phylomes, but also browse through trees and alignments of their choice that had been reconstructed in the phylomes. It currently contains more than 120 public phylomes spread through the three domains of life. The amount of trees and alignments found in the database has already exceeded 1.5 million. In recent years phylomeDB has also become a referent for orthology and paralogy predictions inferred from the phylogenetic trees it stores. For each tree found in the database, phylomeDB maps speciation and duplication events to the tree from which orthology and paralogy relationships between sequences can be inferred. This is complemented by a direct link to metaPhOrs (1), which creates consensus lists of orthologs and paralogs obtained from some of the major tree databases. Also, lists of complete predictions can be downloaded for a complete phylome. One of the main features in phylomeDB is the enriched visualization of stored trees. Interactive images, created using ETE (2), allow the user to visualize additional information about the sequences being displayed and to perform several modifications such as changing the root of the tree or the order of the leaves. It also contains links that can provide the user with more information about the sequences used to reconstruct the phylome and also links to other major protein databases.","In the last phylomeDB version the amount of phylomes provided to the public has increased to 120. This includes a large group of newly created prokaryotic phylomes, which was one of the areas where phylomeDB was lacking information. In addition, phylomeDB is part of the Quest for Orthologs initiative (3,4) which tries to establish standards for orthology and paralogy predictions. Given the increasing amount of phylomes registered in PhylomeDB we have introduced the phylome collections, which are groups of phylomes that were generated for a common project or that contain phylomes reconstructed for a particular group of species. Tree images have also been enhanced and more information has been added to them. The main new feature introduced in the trees is the graphs that represent the mappings of protein domains onto each leaf of the tree. For each leaf in the tree a small graph represents the sequence by mapping protein domains onto it. Regions not included in protein domains are represented by colored lines according to their amino acid composition, empty parts of the graph represent gaps in the alignment.","The authors wish to thank members of Gabaldon's group, the quest for orthologs consortium and PhylomeDB users for their suggestions and feedback. They also thank Cristina Amil for her collaboration and CRG scientific IT for their support.","1. Pryszcz LP, Huerta-Cepas J, Gabaldon T.

HmtDB consists of a database of Human Mitochondrial Genomes, annotated with population data, and a set of bioinformatics tools, able to produce site-specific variability data and to automatically characterize newly sequenced human mitochondrial genomes. HmtDB is structured in five macro-functions: ""Query"", ""Analyze your genome"", ""Submission"", ""HmtDB downloading"" and ""Session Query History"", available from the Menu page. The Query page allows the users to draw data from HmtDB, through a multi criterion form made up of pop-up menus and free text retrieval windows. The Analyze your genome function can be used to automatically characterize a mitochondrial sequence. Through the Submission page the users can submit a new human mitochondrial genome. HmtDB downloading allows the researchers to view and download multi-aligned sequence data and site-specific nucleotide variability data, both regarding the entire database, continent specific and patient subsets. Intra-human and inter-species aminoacid variability data estimated on the 13 coding for proteins genes of the available human genomes and 60 mammalian species are also available. Thanks to the existence of Session Query History, the users can view the history of previously performed analyses. The current release of HmtDB provides access to variability and sequence data of 2879 human mitochondrial genomes from normal subjects and 609 from subjects with clinical phenotype (update September 2007). The human mitochondrial genomes in HmtDB are fully annotated with information about sample: ethnic origin, age, phenotype of the subject and tissue. HmtDB is freely available at http://www.hmdb.uniba.it. The HmtDB project has contributed to complete and/or refine human mitochondrial haplogroup classification on the basis of variability estimation. Indeed, variability the nucleotidic mitochondrial sites, presenting discriminating variability values estimated to the continent-specific datasets compared to the rest of the world, can be considered good population markers (Accetturo et al.2006).

Best of authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knowledge no method have been developed in the field of innate immunity. Innate immune system has long been thought of just as the first line of defense whose only function is to contain the infection until the real player i.e. cells of adaptive immune response ready for defense. Recently, it has been demonstrated in number studies that the innate immune system does not merely acts as the first line of defense but provides critical signals for the development of specific adaptive immune response. In order to assist scientific community, we collected and compiled information related to innate immunity from literature and public databases (e.g. Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL).
Pattern-recognition receptors are germ-line encoded receptors, employed by the innate immune system to recognize evolutionarily conserved patterns from pathogens called Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). These receptors are necessary for guiding adaptive immune system for generating appropriate response against any pathogen. A database PRRDB has been developed that provides extensive information pattern recognizing receptors (PRRs) and their ligands. It contains around 500 PRRs sequences belonging to 77 distinct organisms ranging from insects to humans (See Figure 1). This includes 177 Toll-like receptors, 124 are Scavenger receptors, 20 are mannose receptors, 41 are C-type lectin like domain containing receptors, 17 are DC-SIGN, 43 are Peptidoglycan recognition receptors and 67 are Nucleotide Binding Site-Leucine repeats rich receptors. These receptors have been also classified as single-pass type I/II membrane proteins, multi-pass membrane protein, cytoplasmic or secreted proteins depending upon their site of expression. The database also provides information about 228 PRR ligands (79 endogenous and 149 exogenous). The database covers wide range of ligands including carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, glycolipids, glycoproteins, lipopeptides. PRRDB also provides a number of online web tools that allow users to retrieve information and analyze data. It includes keyword search and browsing of PRRs and ligands, similarity search against PRRs. It provides external links to number of databases including Swiss-Prot and Pubmed.

Information extracted from three taxonomic reference databases together with their type strains is incorporated as well.

Through the online interface of the StrainInfo.net Bioportal, organisms can be searched by strain number, taxonomic name (optionally restricted to type strains of these species), INSDC accession number, full text or combinations of the previous search parameters. Query results redirect the user on-the-fly to the online catalogues of the different culture collections that have a given strain that matches the query in their holdings. Additional pointers allow the user to navigate the downstream information available on these organisms, thereby rendering superfluous the need to browse a multitude of autonomous and heterogeneous information sources. For each organism, a list of all sequences deposited in the INSDC databases is given as a separate view. This overview is dynamically compiled irrespective of the strain numbers assigned to different cultures of the same organism during the sequence deposition process, solving possible Babel-like confusions. Sequence records are linked out to the corresponding records in the INSDC databases and the SILVA database.

Pathway analysis allowed us to select putative drug target candidates. The database also contains all drugs available on the Kegg drug database (5), thus enabling us to indicate enzymes known to be targeted in other organisms.",,"The authors would like to acknowledge the genome sequencing consortium, TIGR, and WTSI for the availability of the genome assembly and annotation of S. mansoni.

Each ATGC is a taxonomy-independent cluster of 2 or more completely sequenced genomes that meet the objective criteria of a high degree of local gene order (synteny) and a small number of synonymous substitutions in the protein-coding genes. As such, each ATGC is suited for analysis of microevolutionary variations within a cohesive group of organisms (e.g., species), whereas the entire collection of ATGCs is useful for macroevolutionary studies. The ATGC database includes many forms of pre-computed data, in particular ATGC-COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Genes), multiple sequence alignments, a set of â€œindexâ€\x9D orthologs representing the most well-conserved members of each ATGC-COG, the phylogenetic tree of the organisms within each ATGC, etc. Although the ATGC database contains several million proteins from thousands of genomes organized into hundreds of clusters (roughly a 4-fold increase since the last version of the ATGC database), it is now built with completely automated methods and will be regularly updated following new releases of the NCBI RefSeq database.

We have implemented EVOG (Evolution Visualizer for Overlapping Genes), a Web-based database with a novel visualization interface, to investigate the evolutionary relationship between overlapping genes. Here we study comparatively the extent of overlapping genes in thirteen genomes by analyzing the public databases of expressed sequences using a set of computational tools designed to identify overlapping genes on opposite DNA strands of the same genomic locus. Using this technique, we collected and analyzed all overlapping genes in human, chimpanzee, orangutan, marmoset, rhesus, cow, dog, mouse, rat, chicken, Xenopus, zebrafish, and Drosophila. This integrated service provides a manually curated database that displays the evolutionary features of overlapping genes. The EVOG database components included a number of overlapping genes (10074 in human, 10009 in chimpanzee, 67039 in orangutan, 51001 in marmoset, 219 in rhesus, 3627 in cow, 209 in dog, 10700 in mouse, 7987 in rat, 1439 in chicken, 597 in Xenopus, 2457 in zebrafish and 4115 in Drosophila).

HGPD was released at the end of 2008. HGPD is accessed though http://www.HGPD.jp/ or http://www.HGPD.lifesciencedb.jp/ (mirror site).
In a project of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) in Japan, full-length human cDNA sequencing of approximately 30,000 human cDNA clones has been carried out (FLJ project; 1,2). For comprehensive and high-throughput expression of human proteins, both full-length cDNA clones and a versatile system for using these clones are essential. For functional analysis of proteins, one often needs to fuse various tags at either the N- or C-termini, to adjust the reading frames of the open reading frame (ORF) and tags or to locate adequate regulatory sequences [promoters, enhancers, internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESes), etc.] close to the ORF. These manipulations can be extremely difficult when a large number of clones are being handled. The Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA USA) is based on versatile expression vectors and has the potential to overcome these barriers (3). We have therefore adopted Gateway technology and constructed 33,275 human Gateway entry clones (4).
In HGPD, biological data such as in vitro expression data of human proteins are presented on the context of cDNA clusters. To build the basic framework, sequences of FLJ cDNAs and others deposited in public databases (Human ESTs, RefSeq, Ensembl, MGC, etc.) are assembled onto genome sequences. Information relating to human Gateway entry clones is presented with the source cDNAs.
Gateway entry clones are available from NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), Department of Biotechnology, National Institute of Technology and Evaluation. Distribution of clones by NBRC requires the signing of an MTA for both private companies and academic institutions (http://www.nbrc.nite.go.jp/e/hgentry-e.html).","In the web interface, ""Protein Info"" of ""Information Overview"" has been improved. In HGPD, when a user ""ID search"" from the top page results in a hit, ""Information Overview"" is presented. This view shows all information available relating to members of the cluster that contains the queried sequence. In this improvement, open reading frame (ORF) is clearly indicated in ""Protein Info"" by a red line. With this annotation, the ORF regions for each cDNA mapping to a given locus are easily seen. Thus, any user can easily browse clone information and request a clone of interest.",,"1.

It is estimated that influenza is responsible for 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually. Genome sequences of currently circulating virus isolates are important sources of information about influenza. Significant efforts have been made to build public resources of influenza viruses such as the Influenza Virus Resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/FLU.html) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the Influenza Sequence Database at Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Influenza Virus Database (http://influenza.psych.ac.cn) at the Beijing Institute of Genomics, and the BioHealthBase Bioinformatics Resource Center (http://www.biohealthbase.org) (1-4). An increasing number of genomes of influenza viruses have been sequenced in Asia in recent years. Southern China has long been considered a potential epicenter for emergence of pandemic influenza viruses and becomes one of the major foci for viral surveillance.","In order to leverage the wealth of information, we have developed an integrated user friendly relational database, Influenza Sequence and Epitope Database (ISED) (1), particularly focusing on the genomes of the seasonal influenza viruses from Asian countries. We have added value by implementing a suite of bioinformatics tools that can be used to analyze and visualize the influenza data. This freely accessible resource will augment influenza research and contribute to improved public heath.","We wish to acknowledge the technical support from Mr. C. H.

These replication domains replicate in a stable, cell type-specific temporal order during S-phase that is closely linked to their 3 dimensional organization in the nucleus and the expression of genes within each replication domain (Hiratani et al., Genome Res, 2010). ReplicationDomain is a database customized for analysis of genome-wide replication timing maps (replication profiles) from various cell lines and species and comparison to other genome-wide properties of chromosomes, such as transcription and chromatin immunoprecipitation data, which can also be uploaded and viewed (Weddington et al., BMC Bioinformatics, 2008). Users may graphically display these data sets for a selected genomic region and download the data displayed as text files, or alternatively, download complete genome-wide data sets. ReplicationDomain is considerably faster and more convenient than existing browsers when viewing multi-megabase segments of chromosomes. Furthermore, we have implemented a user registration system that allows registered users to upload their own data sets. Upon uploading, registered users may choose to: (1) view their data sets privately without sharing; (2) share their data sets with any subset of the sites registered users; or (3) make their published or Ã¢â‚¬Å“in pressÃ¢â‚¬Â\x9D data sets publicly available.","Since our last update (Nov., 2011), we have improved the ability of users to set up projects to recall and display specific datasets.

These movies show the protein dynamics in space and in time in individual living human cancer cells in response to an anti-cancer drug, camptothecin.
Recent advances in molecular cell biology allow tracking the levels and locations of over a thousand proteins in individual living human cancer cells over time using a library of annotated reporter cell clones (LARC). This library was created by Cohen et al. to study proteome dynamics in individual living cells of a human lung carcinoma cell-line treated with the anti-cancer drug, camptothecin [1]. Here, we report the Dynamic Proteomics database for the proteins studied by Cohen et al [1]. Each cell-line clone in the LARC library has a protein tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP or Venus), expressed from its endogenous chromosomal location and under its natural regulation [2-4]. The Dynamic Proteomics interface facilitates searches for genes of interest as well as downloads of protein fluorescent movies and alignments of protein dynamics following drug addition [1]. Each protein in the database is displayed with a detailed annotation, its cDNA sequence, fluorescent images and movies obtained by time-lapse microscopy. The protein dynamics in the database represent a quantitative trace of the tagged-protein fluorescence levels in the nucleus and cytoplasm produced by image analysis of the movies over time [1-4]. Furthermore, a sequence analysis tool provides a search and comparison of up to 50 input DNA sequences with all cDNAs in the library. The raw movies presented in the database may be useful as a benchmark for developing image analysis tools for individual-cell dynamic proteomics.","Dynamic Proteomics (www.dynamicproteomics.net) currently collects 2,191 clones or 1,144 unique YFP-tagged proteins in human cells. Recent developments to the database include an addition of new search parameters (i.e. Chromosome Number and Alternative Names) with a possibility to download sequences of all clones in the Fasta format from any Search Results page. In addition, annotation of the clones and their sequences are updated on a regular basis.","We thank the Kahn Family Foundation, the Israel Science Foundation and the Horowitz Center for Complexity Science for project support.","1.

The content of this database derives from curation, re-annotation and statistical analysis of selected data from the ArrayExpress Archive of Functional Genomics Data. A simple interface allows the user to query for differential gene expression either 1) by gene names or attributes such as Gene Ontology terms, or 2) by biological conditions, e.g. diseases, organism parts or cell types. The gene queries return the conditions where expression has been reported, while condition queries return which genes are reported to be expressed in these conditions. A combination of both query types is possible. The query results are ranked using various statistical measures and by how many independent studies in the database show the particular gene-condition association. Currently the database contains information about more than 200,000 genes from 9 species and almost 4,500 biological conditions studied in over 30,000 assays from over 1,000 independent studies.",,"In addition to the invaluable help from the entire Microarray Team, we would like to thank especially the work of Richard Coulson, Ekaterina Pilicheva, Niran Abeygunawardena and Ugis Sarkans on the gene re-annotation pipeline.

The collection includes plasmids from grant-funded, high-throughput cloning projects performed in our laboratory, plasmids from external researchers, and large collections from consortia such as the ORFeome Collaboration and the NIGMS-funded Protein Structure Initiative: Biology (PSI:Biology). Through DNASU, researchers can search for and access detailed information about each plasmid such as the full length gene sequence, vector information, associated publications, and links to external resources that provide additional protein annotations and experimental protocols. Plasmids can be requested directly through the DNASU website. Overall, these plasmid resources continue to enable research with the goal of elucidating the role of proteins in both normal biological processes and disease","Since the first report in 2010 (1,2), the number of clones stored and distributed through DNASU has nearly doubled to 197,000 plasmids containing gene inserts from over 700 species. Over 74,000 of these plasmids contain human genes, representing ~15,000 unique human genes. In addition to adding new plasmids to DNASU, we have considerably updated the website annotations and search capabilities. DNASUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s five search options have been improved and six new browse features were created to provide flexibility in finding plasmids within the database. The clone annotations page was also overhauled to provide detailed, well-annotated information about each plasmid on a single easy-to-navigate page that can be accessed directly from the search results. Plasmid information is now organized into three tabs containing information about the gene insert, the vector, and annotations. This information includes the new Dynamic (DyNA) Vector Map widget was created in collaboration with LabGenius. We continue to distribute plasmids to researchers worldwide with the added convenience of handling the Material Transfer Agreement through our Expedited MTA Network. Finally, DNASU openly encourages researchers to deposit plasmids in the repository, which functions as a secure archive site and alleviates the researcherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s burden of storage, maintenance, and distribution of plasmids.","DNASU and PSI:Biology-Materials Repository would like to thank all plasmid depositors, outreach partners and collaborators.

In this relational database, we collected the spatial patterns of protein binding sites including both holo and apo forms from more than 40,000 structures. To identify protein binding sites, we model the shape of a split pocket induced by a binding ligand(s). Essentially, we use a purely geometric method to extract site-specific spatial patterns of split pockets as templates to match those from unbound structures. To perform an effective shape comparison, we utilize the Smith-Waterman algorithm to footprint an unbound pocket fragment with those selected from the canonical functional surfaces of >19,000 structures in the SplitPocket (http://pocket.med.wayne.edu/). The pairwise alignment of the unbound and split-pocket fragments is superimposed to evaluate the local structural similarity for detecting the unbound split characteristic through the RMSD measurement. Furthermore, we conduct a large-scale computation to systematically identify binding sites of proteins. In addition to the geometric measurements, we extensively measure the propensity of surface conservation encapsulated in the evolutionary history.",,,,Structure Databases,Protein structure,,,,,

Due to the inherent high receptor selectivity and lower target-based toxicity, allosteric regulation is also expected to play a more positive role in drug discovery and bioengineering, leading to rapid growth on allosteric findings. Allosteric Database (ASD) provides a central resource for the display, search and analysis of the structure, function and related annotation for allosteric molecules. Currently, ASD contains allosteric proteins from more than 100 species and modulators in three categories(activators, inhibitors, and regulators). Each protein is annotated with detailed description of allostery, biological process and related diseases, and each modulator with binding affinity, physicochemical properties and therapeutic area. Integrating the information of allosteric proteins in ASD should allow for the prediction of allostery for unknown proteins and eventually make them ideal targets for experimental validation. In addition, modulators curated in ASD can be used to investigate potent allosteric targets for the query compound, and also help chemists to implement structure modifications for novel allosteric drug design. Therefore, ASD could be a platform and a starting point for biologists and medicinal chemists for furthering allosteric research.","Recently, ASD in 2012 has doubly expanded allosteric proteins, allosteric diseases and allosteric modulators. Experimentally validated allosteric pathway, structural pairs of orthosteric and allosteric sites, and allosteric DNAs and RNAs were added. Furthermore, a suite of computational modules to help allosteric studies were added in 2012.","We thank all staff of MDL at Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine for the data curation, annotation, release and web development.","1.

Almeida, Eliane Correa-de-Santana, Alice R. de Oliveira, Alex S. Mundstein, Wilson Savino and Ana T. R. de Vasconcelos",,lm@lncc.br,"Laminins (LM) correspond to a large number of heretotrimeric glycoproteins, playing and a major role in several cell functions, including differentiation, proliferation, adhesion, and migration [1-3]. In addition to binding to other extracellular matrix proteins, laminins bind specific cell membrane receptors, several of them are integrins, such as ÃŽÂ±3ÃŽÂ²1, ÃŽÂ±6ÃŽÂ²1, ÃŽÂ±6ÃŽÂ²4 and ÃŽÂ±7ÃŽÂ²1 [2, 4]. 
For example, laminin-mediated interactions are relevant for the entrance of T cell precursors into the thymus [5, 6], the migration of developing thymocytes, both in mice and humans [7, 8 , 9], as well as in peripheral lymphoid organs [10, 11]. Also, activated T cells use laminin receptors to migrate across endothelial barriers, as exemplified by the role of laminin isoforms in leukocyte extravasation in the central nervous system [12, 13]. 
Moreover, the effector immune function in rejection of heart grafts can be abrogated by blocking laminin- ÃŽÂ±6ÃŽÂ²1 interaction with antibodies specific for the ligand or the corresponding receptor [14, 15]. In fact, blockade of the ÃŽÂ±6ÃŽÂ²1 receptor also prevents neutrophils to cross basement lamina [16]. Lastly, laminins are presently demonstrated to be involved in pathophysiology and/or pathogenesis in neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases [17, 18, 19, 20]. 
Taking together, one can easily realize the high degree of biological complexity in laminin-mediated interactions, in both health and disease. The Laminin Database provides a comprehensive repository for public data concerning laminins and related proteins, which is collected and manually curated and annotated, allowing the user to easily retrieve highthroughput data available, but so far dispersed in the net. Further, external links are provided underlying data infrastructure for services such as Ensembl, UniProt and NCBI. The LM Database includes the 16 known laminins, 10 integrin type receptors, 9 non integrin type receptors and 6 extracellular laminin-binding proteins. 
For each protein provided at the database, the following items are stored: summary, information concerning protein details, gene structure, gene expression and tissue distribution, therapy and reference(s) to relevant paper(s). The information can be retrieved for three particular organisms, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Ratus novergicus. The database is available on line at http://www.lm.lncc.br.

Owing to the biological significance of miRNAs, miRTarBase was developed to provide comprehensive information on experimentally validated miRNAâ€“target interactions (MTIs). To date, the database has accumulated >13,404 validated MTIs from 11,021 articles from manual curations. In this update, a text-mining system was incorporated to enhance the recognition of MTI-related articles by adopting a scoring system. In addition, a variety of biological databases were integrated to provide information on the regulatory network of miRNAs and its expression in blood. Not only targets of miRNAs but also regulators of miRNAs are provided to users for investigating the up- and downstream regulations of miRNAs. Moreover, the number of MTIs with high-throughput experimental evidence increased remarkably (validated by CLIP-seq technology). In conclusion, these improvements promote the miRTarBase as one of the most comprehensively annotated and experimentally validated miRNAâ€“target interaction databases.",,,,RNA sequence databases,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz896

Non-canonical protein termini can be the result of multiple different biological processes, including pre-translational processes such as alternative splicing and alternative translation initiation or post-translational protein processing by proteases that cleave proteases as part of protein maturation or as a regulatory modification. Accordingly, protein termini evidence in TopFIND is inferred from other databases such as ENSEMBL (4) transcripts, TISdb (5) for alternative translation initiation, MEROPS (6) for protein cleavage by proteases, and UniProt (7) for canonical and protein isoform start sites. Additionally, termini are annotated from user submitted lists of termini and inferred from user submitted lists of cleavage sites. 
As a protein-centric database, TopFIND presents a website for each protein isoform (organized around UniProt accession codes). These websites contain general protein information, such as organism, chromosome location, and proteins sequence. They then list position information such as specific termini evidences, known cleavage sites, sequence features and domains for each protein. In addition, TopFIND shows each protein in the context of the protease web, a network of proteases and their inhibitors, where a protease can cleave of other proteases and their inhibitors thus influencing their activity (8). All information in TopFIND can be filtered by a powerful filter engine that relies on rich annotation as to the origin of data in TopFIND. TopFIND can also be programmatically queried using the PSICQUIC or XML API.","Software tools were developed to enable quick access to TopFIND data for lists of termini obtained by, for example, proteomic termini screens (terminomics). TopFIND Explorer â€œTopFINDerâ€\x9D reports position specific protein information for protein termini, such as terminus evidences, prime and non-prime sequences, and protein domains affected by cleavage. TopFINDer further reports summary statistics for protein cleavage by known proteases. PathFINDer is a second tool that reports proteolytic paths from a query protease to identified protein substrates thus enabling the differentiation between direct and indirect protease substrates and yielding mechanistic insights into pathways based on existing information.","We thank all members of the Overall and Pavlidis labs at UBC, as well as Natalie Marshall, for many helpful discussions.

We herein outline the updated web user interfaces together with RESTful web services and the backend relational database that support the former. To enhance the interoperability of the PDB data, we have previously developed PDB/RDF, PDB data in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, which is now a wwPDB standard called wwPDB/RDF. We have enhanced the connectivity of the wwPDB/RDF data by incorporating various external data resources.

ExoCarta is a manually curated database that contains molecular data on unpublished and published exosomal studies. It catalogs information on the exosomal isolation and purification procedures, samples used, investigator details and exosomal molecular components such as proteins, mRNA and miRNA as reported in the scientific literature. ExoCarta can be queried using the gene symbol/name or browsed as a group based on the organism, molecular content type and the sample material. Currently, ExoCarta (Version 4) contains information on 13,333 protein entries, 2,375 mRNA entries and 764 miRNA entries resulting from 146 exosomal studies. We believe that this free web-based community resource will aid researchers in identifying molecular signatures (proteins/RNA/lipids) that are specific to certain tissue/cell type derived exosomes and initiate new exosomal studies.","Inclusion of lipid data, data deposition by exosomal researchers",,"1.

The OrtholugeDB resource facilitates improved microbial comparative analysis by offering:
-A unique approach to ortholog prediction, called Ortholuge that focuses on identifying the subset orthologs best suited for comparative genomics applications rather than all evolutionary orthologs. Ortholuge evaluates predicted orthologs, identifying those whose divergence reflects the species level of divergence. These orthologs are more likely to have similar functions. OrtholugeDB makes Ortholuge-based ortholog predictions readily available to the microbial research community (note however, availability of Ortholuge evaluations is determined by the availability of a suitable reference outgroup species. When no suitable outgroup species exists, RBB-based predictions are still presented).
-In-paralog predictions based on the InParanoid method. In-paralogs are genes that have duplicated subsequent to species divergence. Gene duplication can alter gene function (for example through subfunctionalization).
-Pre-computed ortholog groups that have been constructed for multiple hierarchical levels that represent consistent, phylogenetic groups. Instead of relying on taxonomic classifications such as Genus, Family etc. that are highly variable in terms of evolutionary relatedness, we computed consistent groupings using a distance metric. This approach allows researchers to select the ortholog group level with the desired scope and accuracy (ortholog groups constructed for closely related species are often more accurate).
-Features that facilitate the rapid of extraction of bacterial and archaeal orthologs. OrtholugeDB provides multiple types of queries that allow the retrieval of orthologs for single genes to multiple genomes. These search interfaces are designed to be straightforward and easy to use. We also provide the ability to perform complex queries that identify genes that have or lack orthologs in multiple other species. Result pages provide visualizations, such as the ortholog group graph view, the phyletic matrix view and the gene context view, that help with evaluating and conceptualizing ortholog data. Data can be downloaded in multiple formats.

MFSs are three-dimensional templates that describe the local environment around the metal(s) independently of the larger context of the macromolecular structure embedding the site(s), and are the central objects of MetalPDB design. MFSs are grouped into equistructural (broadly defined as sites found in corresponding positions in similar structures) and equivalent sites (equistructural sites that contain the same metals), allowing users to easily analyze similarities and variations in metal-macromolecule interactions, and to link them to functional information.

Hence, these secretory organelles play key roles in bacterial genome plasticity and pathogenesis. SecReT4 is an integrated database providing comprehensive information of type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) in bacteria. SecReT4 presents reported and predicted essential components that make up T4SS instruments, and effectors delivered by T4SSs, in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. All the component data have been curated and re-annotated according to a set of reference T4SSs. Components are not only organized by entire T4SSs but can also be analyzed alongside other components in SecReT4 belonging to the same bit part. SecReT4 has classified all archived T4SSs based on two known classification schemes (3,4). Furthermore, references have been collected, mined and mapped to T4SSs and effectors. The database provides functional descriptions for T4SSs, T4SS components and cognate effectors according to findings reported in the literature. To organize and display these data in an efficient manner, we designed a customized PostgreSQL schema and developed a user-friendly web-interface. The SecReT4 browse module contains detailed information on all archived T4SSs, matching essential component parts and T4SS effector molecules.

RhesusBase was thus developed to refine genome-wide macaque gene structures, to integrate macaque functional annotations,and to provide a 'one-stop' knowledgebase for the primate research community. 
28.7% of the rhesus macaque transcripts were convincingly revised on the basis of ~1.2 billion RNA-Seq reads generatedby strand-specific mRNA sequencing in ten macaque tissues (covering >97.4% of macaque exons).Functional genomics annotations from >60 categories of public and in-house resources were integrated, and multiple interfaces were developed to update,retrieve, visualize, and download the RhesusBase meta-data (Zhang et al, Nucleic Acids Res, 2012).Following the rapid pace of NGS technologies, RhesusBase was updated on the transcriptome and regulatory annotations annually, with the current version of the database containing 172million functional annotation records derived from 1,761 NGS data sets. Especially, We developed Molecular Evolution Gateway, an NGS-orientedgenomic framework to access and visualize macaque annotations in reference to human orthologous genes and the associated regulations, and PopGateway, the firstgenome-wide effort to identify and visualize the population genetics profile in rhesus monkey.

The majority of the human genome transcripts are noncoding RNAs, in particular, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) (2). In recent years, accumulating studies have revealed that a number of lncRNAs are not transcriptional noise but have important functions. More recently, researchers have attempted to understand the relationships between lncRNAs and diseases. Studies have reported that lncRNA dysfunctions are associated with a broad range of diseases (3), including cancers (4), cardiovascular diseases(5), and neurodegeneration diseases (6).
The study of lncRNA-disease associations is becoming one of the most important topics of lncRNAs and diseases. For this reason, a high quality lncRNA-disease association database will be helpful in studying the roles of lncRNAs in diseases but is still not available. In this paper, we describe a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and disease association database (LncRNADisease), which is publicly accessible at http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/lncrnadisease.

We captured information on hallmark features of 3D domain swapping phenomenon from the literature. For example: the presence of largely unstructured regions that connect two regions of swapped structures called 'hinge regions' and one or more structured segments called 'swapped regions' were observed in swapped proteins. Further, we have integrated the literature-curated information and structural bioinformatics pipeline to identify the boundaries of hinge and swapped regions in protein structures involved in swapping. We have also introduced several new concepts like 'secondary major interface' and an algorithm to find 'extent of swapping' for systematic exploration of swapping in protein structures.

The database offers convenient search and browse utilities in 3DSwap. Database can be searched using keywords targeting multiple annotation database and sequence similarity searches can be performed by using hinge sequence and swapped sequence target database. 3DSwap also offers tools for visualization of swapped segments and hinge regions, annotated topology diagrams, amino acid plots and structural features.

Many genomes contain a large fraction of repetitive DNA, much of which is made up of remnants of transposable elements (TEs). Accurate annotation of TEs enables research into their biology and can shed light on the evolutionary processes that shape genomes. Identification and masking of TEs can also greatly simplify many downstream genome annotation and sequence analysis tasks. The commonly-used TE annotation tools RepeatMasker and Censor depend on sequence homology search tools such as cross_match and BLAST variants, as well as Repbase, a collection of known TE families each represented by a single consensus sequence. Dfam contains entries corresponding to all Repbase TE entries for which instances have been found in the human genome. Each Dfam entry is represented by a profile hidden Markov model (HMM), built from alignments generated using RepeatMasker and Repbase. When used in conjunction with the HMM search tool nhmmer, Dfam produces a 2.9% increase in coverage over consensus-sequence search methods on a large human benchmark, while maintaining low false discovery rates, and coverage of the full human genome is 54.5%.

A large part of relevant information is buried in the literature or collected in various different databases. By hand-curated screenings of literature and databases we retrieved experimentally assessed data on 71 human RNA-binding splicing regulatory proteins and organized them into a database called â€œSpliceAid-Fâ€\x9D. For each splicing factor (SF) the database reports its functional domains and its protein and chemical interactors. Furthermore, we collected experimentally validated RNA-SF interactions, including relevant information on the RNA binding sites such as the genes where these sites lie, their genomic coordinates, the splicing effects, experimental procedures, as well as the corresponding bibliographic references. We also collected information from experiments showing no RNA-SF binding, at least in the assayed conditions.
In total, SpliceAid-F contains 4227 interactions, 2622 RNA binding sites and 1170 no-binding sites, including information on binding and no-binding specificity in different cellular contexts. Data collected in SpliceAid-F can provide significant information to explain an observed splicing pattern as well as the effect of mutations in functional regulatory elements.",,,,Nucleotide Sequence Databases,"Gene structure, introns and exons, splice sites",,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks997

The DNA shape features were predicted using our recently published high-throughput method (1) and visualized in the form of heat maps. Users can download these DNA shape feature data and perform further analysis, for example, to identify which DNA shape feature(s) at which position(s) in the target DNA contribute to the DNA binding specificity of a TF. Users can also compare DNA shape profiles, both qualitatively and quantitatively, between two TF datasets from the database, or between a set of uploaded sequences and a TF from the database. TFBSshape collects data from the open-access motif databases JASPAR (2) and UniPROBE (3). However, TFBSshape is fundamentally different from the two databases in that it provides DNA shape profiles for TFBSs in addition to sequence information. The JASPAR database provides TFBSs for a significant portion of its TF collection. For these TFs, TFBSshape uses our high-throuput method to predict DNA shape features for the TFBSs. On the other hand, the UniPROBE provides only protein binding microarray (PBM) probes and PWMs derived from the PBM experiments for the TFs, instead of specific TFBSs. In this case, TFBSshape first uses FIMO (4) to scan the PBM probes for TFBSs given the probe sequences and UniPROBE PWMs as input. DNA shape feature are then predicted for these TFBSs found by FIMO. Since DNA shape has been shown to play an important role in protein-DNA recognition (5), providing DNA shape feature data for TFBSs derived from motif databases will help to advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying TF-DNA interactions.",,"This work was supported by the USC-Technion Visiting Fellows Program, an Alfred P.

Our database includes 122 proteomes, 97 eukaryotic and 25 bacterial ones that can be divided into 9 kingdoms and 5 phyla of bacteria. Considering these proteomes we have 1 449 561 protein sequences. The database includes 771 786 of proteins with GO annotations. It has been found that leucine repeats were especially abundant in the ""Receptor and/or Membrane"" group, glutamine and alanine repeats in Transcription factor and/or Development, and lysine repeats in Metabolism (2, 3). HRaP can be used to analyze evolution differences between proteins from different proteomes and connections of these regions with some definite functions. To see the occurrence of a homorepeat, at the first step the user should choose a proteome among 122 considered ones, and then at the second step choose the investigated homorepeat with the given length or pattern. After that the list of proteins with the given homorepeat or pattern appears with GO annotations (if such is determined). Usually, long proteins contain a homorepeat or several different homorepeats. If several homorepeats and patterns exist in a protein then all these regions will be marked by different colors in the sequence. In the section HomoRepeats or Patterns you can find the occurrence of homorepeats with different lengths (or patterns) for all 122 proteomes.","The patterns and homorepeats assotiated with the functions are presented in section GO annotations. We have determined homorepeats and patterns that are associated with some function. We have created the list of human proteins with homorepeats that are associated with disease. The list can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section. Also, the list of proteins with homorepeats of 6 and more residues long from the clustered Protein Data Bank (4, 5) can be found in FAQ section.","We thank O.V.

Two types of enzymes, known as protein kinase and protein phosphatase, are responsible for this reversible reaction and almost constitute about 2~4% of the genes in a typical eukaryotic genome (Moorhead et al., 2009). Protein kinase is a type of well understood enzyme which modifies other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups to them (phosphorylation). Protein kinases have been found to be involved in varieties of cellular processes, including metabolism (Viollet and Andreelli 2011), transcription, cell cycle progression (Moniz et al., 2011), cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell movement (Huang et al., 2009), cell apoptosis (Wang, 2000), and differentiation (Taylor et al., 2011). Contrary to phosphorylation, dephosphorylation is catalyzed by protein phosphatase through a way of removing a phosphate group from its substrate. Protein phosphatases contain two groups, PSP and PTP, which are responsible for the ser/thr dephosphorylation and tyr dephosphorylation respectively. Like protein kinases, protein phosphatases also play an important role in a lot of cellular processes, including proliferation (Zhang et al., 2012), differentiation, cell adhesion (Bessette et al., 2008), motility and cell death (Gallego et al., 2005). As the critical roles in biological processes, abnormal level of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation is implicated in diseases, such as myotonic muscular dystrophy, hirschsprungis disease, leprechaunism, diabetes and so on (Cohen, 2001). 
Although the studies on phosphorylation and dephosphorylation last for a long time, and many related resources have been developed, however, a comprehensive classification of all protein kinases and protein phosphatases and how many potential two types of enzymes exist in usual and rare species still remains not to be available. In this work, we have collected 347 protein phosphatase data from literatures, integrated and curated five protein kinase complements of H. sapiens, M. musculus, D. melanogaster, C. elegans and S. cerevisiae from KinBase with a total number of 1,855. The data are further classified into 10 groups and 33 families for protein phosphatase, 10 groups and 149 families for protein kinase, respectively. The protein kinase and protein phosphatase identification in 84 eukaryotic species is based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) of their catalytic domains (Eddy, 1998). Currently, the Eukaryotic Kinase and Phosphatase Database -- EKPD is the most comprehensive resource to get protein kinases and protein phosphatases information in eukaryotic organisms.",,,,Metabolic and Signaling Pathways,Enzymes and enzyme nomenclature,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt1121

COLOMBOS, name derived from the acronym 'COLections Of for Bacterial OrganismS', was originally published in PLoS One (1) and hosts several large expression compendia derived from high-throughput expression experiments with an explicit focus on bacterial organisms. The expression experiments available in COLOMBOS are derived from public resources, such as the Gene Expression Omnibus(2) or ArrayExpress(3) repositories, but the actual data originates from a reanalysis starting from the raw hybridization intensities for microarrays or short read sequences for RNA-seq using a consistent and robust normalization pipeline with stringent quality controls at each step. This procedure yields high quality expression compendia that can directly integrate high-throughput expression data from different technological platforms.","The current version (v2.0) of COLOMBOS includes both an update of the expression data, by expanding the previously available compendia and by adding compendia for several new species, and an update of the surrounding functionality, with improved search and visualization options and novel tools for programmatic access to the database. The scope of the database has also been extended to incorporate RNA-seq data in our compendia by a dedicated analysis pipeline. We demonstrate the validity and robustness of this approach by comparing the same RNA samples measured using both microarrays and RNA-seq. As far as we know, COLOMBOS currently hosts the largest homogenized gene expression compendia available for seven bacterial model organisms.",,"¹.

Manually Curated Database of Rice Proteins,https://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/summary/1743,http://www.genomeindia.org/biocuration,"Priyanka Garg, Rashmi Jain, Shaji V. Joseph, Akhilesh K. Tyagi, Saurabh Raghuvanshi","Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, New Delhi 110021, India",saurabh@genomeindia.org,"Manually Curated Database of Rice Proteins (MCDRP) is a unique manually curated database based on published experimental data. Semantic integration of scientific data is essential to gain a higher level of understanding of biological systems. Since the majority of scientific data is available as published literature, text mining is an essential step before the data can be integrated and made available for computer-based search in various databases. However, text mining is a tedious exercise and thus, there is a large gap in the data available in curated databases and published literature. Moreover, data in an experiment can be perceived from several perspectives, which may not reflect in the text based curation. In order to address such issues, we have demonstrated the feasibility of digitizing the experimental data itself by creating a database on rice proteins based on in-house developed data curation models. Digitization of experimental data itself offers several advantages: 1. Digitization renders the experimental data amenable to computerized search such that exact data from multiple articles can be searched/retrieved rapidly. 2. Digitization into a standard computer readable format would facilitate a seamless and semantic integration of data. 3. Data models for digitization of experimental data may be extended further to enable pre-publication integration of data. Thus, from the very beginning, the data would be in a format where it can be integrated into any database with minimal manual intervention. Such approach would help close the gap between the curated databases and the accumulated scientific literature. The manual curation workflow adopted in developing the database is designed to digitize the actual experimental data (presented as images or graphs) published in peer-reviewed articles. We developed a data curation workflow that was guided by the need to digitize experimental data as well as to lay foundation for development of standard representation of experimental data. In simple terms, every data-point in a graph or image represents data of several dimensions such as gene name, plant type, tissue and growth conditions. A combined systematic use of ontologies and notations has been done to represent information contained in every data point such that every data point is represented by a collection of these pre-defined terms. Since the notations are alphanumeric in nature with pre-defined definition, the data is stored in a relational database and can be easily searched and correlated. The current release of the database catalogues data for over 1800 rice genes from about 400 peer-reviewed research articles. Data from more than 4000 different experiments have been digitized using in-house developed manual data curation models. These experiments are based on a total of about 140 different experimental techniques mostly related to gene expression analysis, biochemical activity analysis, protein-protein interaction, DNA-protein interaction and cellular/sub-cellular localization. Since every aspect (gene id, tissue, growth conditions etc.) of the experimental data has been encoded with the help of defined notations (ontologies etc.) it is possible to retrieve the same set of data from several different perspectives. The database can be accessed either by browsing or searching for a particular keyword or term. A global overview of the data from different perspectives (PubMed id, gene/protein id, environmental/growth conditions, plant part/developmental stage or gene function and localization) can be acquired by ""browsing"" the database. Specific queries can be made by searching the database with the help of any of the ontology terms or with the help of a keyword. The database will be updated every 6 months and as the curation progresses the data would be enriched by inclusion of studies from diverse aspects such as biotic stress, yield etc. The ultimate aim is to digitize all the relevant articles but since the task is enormous we are proceeding in a methodical manner so that important aspects such stress biology (abiotic or biotic), yield are better represented.",,"The database is hosted at University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi, India and financed by Department of Biotechnology, Government of India.","Gour P, Garg P, Jain R, Joseph SV, Tyagi AK, Raghuvanshi S.

SoyKB can be publicly accessed at http://soykb.org.","Since the initial publication (2) we have made significant developments and added many new and advanced tools, new types of data and analysis capabilities for our users. We have incorporated two completely new entities to our database from the molecular breeding perspective, which were not part of SoyKB earlier. One is the Plant Introduction (PI) data for ~19,000 soybean germplasm lines from USDA-ARS (http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/index.html) and another is the Trait entity describing phenotypic data. These data have been integrated with our QTLs, SNP and GWAS datasets in our newly developed suite of tools for the In Silico Breeding Program. This suite of tools allows integration and extraction of the data in a tabular format as well as graphical visualization in our in-house Chromosome Visualizer. It also supports integration and visualization of Genotype by Sequencing (GBS) data for molecular breeding and phenotypic inferences.
In addition, SoyKB now has capacity for incorporation of DNA methylation data (3) and fast neutron mutation datasets. It is also linked seamlessly with P3DB (4) for phosphorylation data. We have also incorporated suite of tools for differential expression analysis for microarray, transcriptomics RNA-seq, proteomics and metabolomics datasets. It includes access to gene lists, Venn diagrams, Volcano plots, functional annotations and pathway analysis. SoyKB is now powered by the iPlant (5) Cyber-Infrastructure. The website is hosted on the iPlant's advanced computing infrastructure established to leverage the data analysis capabilities. We are also developing Cyber Studio, an in silico hypothesis generation and testing tool, which will provide various templates for users to conduct multi-omics analysis, signaling pathway construction, gene regulatory network prediction, genotype-phenotype inference, etc. based on protein-protein interaction data, pathways, gene expression and comparative genomics.","The authors wish to thank the labs of Suk-Ha Lee, Jay Thelen, Steve Clough and Melissa Mitchum for contributing data to SoyKB.

In order to account for additional consequences of the mutations, the predicted effects of single point mutations on protein stability (1) and protein-protein affinity (2) in the three-dimensional structure were calculated when a wild-type PDB structure was available.

Viruses can use diverse ncRNAs to manipulate both cellular and viral gene expression to establish a host environment conducive to completion of the viral life cycle. Many host cellular ncRNAs can also directly or indirectly influence viral replication and even target virus genomes [2,4]. ViRBase (http://www.rna-society.org/virbase) aims to provide the scientific community with a resource for efficient browsing and visualization of virus-host ncRNA-associated interactions and interaction networks in viral infection. The current version of ViRBase documents over 12000 viral and cellular ncRNA-associated virus-virus, virus-host, host-virus and host-host interactions by manually curating the literatures, involving more than 60 different viruses and 20 hosts. Most medically relevant viruses are contained within the database, including EBV, HIV-1, HBV, HCV, H1N1, H3N2, KSHV. Researchers can follow these interactions to explore how the virus-host ncRNA-associated interaction network is organized. The whole dataset can be easily queried and downloaded through the webpage, and visualization tools embedding the Cytoscape web tool for interactively browsing and analyzing the dataset are provided. ViRBase also provides 5 options on the â€œHelpâ€\x9D page to provide instructions for using the database. In addition, the identification of RNA-associated binding sites can provide valuable insights into the underlying regulatory mechanisms of various ncRNAs, thus ViRBase also incorporates several useful tools to analyze the predicted binding site information for these interactions.",,"We thank all student for the data collection, annotation and web-page development.

The search for causative cancer driver genes in the human genome is complicated by the presence of passenger mutations which appear in overwhelming numbers, hiding low-penetrance cancer drivers. We have developed a method of identifying low-penetrance drivers by performing forward genetic screens in mice using DNA transposons as mutagens. Molecular analysis of the tumors arising in these mice allows for identification of transposon common insertion sites (CISs), where the frequency of transposon insertion is greater than expected by chance. Genes disrupted by the transposon insertions in these CISs are identified as candidate cancer driver genes. Our lab, along with many other labs, have used this method to identify thousands of candidate cancer driver genes. Unfortunately, the findings are scattered across dozens of publications using different mouse genome builds and strength metrics. We developed the Candidate Cancer Gene Database (CCGD, http://ccgd-starrlab.oit.umn.edu/) to improve access to these findings and facilitate meta-analyses. The CCGD is a manually curated database of candidate driver genes based on transposon CISs from all published, transposon-based forward genetic screens in mice. Users can quickly locate information on a gene of interest or generate a list of driver genes associated with a particular tumor type. The CCGD accepts queries by study and cancer type as well as by human, mouse, rat, fly, zebrafish, or yeast gene symbol or gene ID. The database supports export into a comma-separated file or a BED formatted file. Gene detail pages provide many links to external resources such as databases and genome browsers. To reduce curation burden, we automated many tasks involving processing of downloads from NCBI Gene, NCBI HomoloGene, Sanger CGC, and Sanger COSMIC. As the CCGD incorporates additional studies, it will facilitate identification of pathway and gene mutations specific to subsets of cancer. To demonstrate this potential, we performed a modified gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using KEGG pathwa",,"The authors would like to thank David Largaespada, Vincent Keng and Robert Cormier for their assistance in developing the CCGD.

Disease symptoms, drug side effects and mouse phenotypes are mapped to the System Organ Class (SOC) level of the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Then, the organ system heterogeneity value, a measurement of the systemic impact of a perturbation, is calculated from the relative frequency of phenotypic features across all SOCs. For perturbations of interest, the database displays the distribution of phenotypic effects across organ systems along with the heterogeneity value and the distance between organ system distributions. In this way, it allows, in an easy and comprehensible fashion, the comparison of the phenotypic organ system distributions of diseases, drugs and their corresponding genetically modified mouse models of associated disease genes and drug targets.

The response provides detailed (epi)genetic information, incorporating cell type specificity, nearby genes, transcriptional factor binding sites, CRISPR-Cas9 target sites, evolutionary conservation, SNPs, H3K27ac, DNA methylation, gene expression, and TF ChIP-seq data. Moreover, analytical tools and a genome browser were developed for users to explore super-enhancers and their roles in defining cell identity and disease processes in depth.",,"This project was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province, the Innovation and Technology special Fund for researchers of Harbin Science and Technology Bureau, and the Innovation Research Fund for Graduate Students of Harbin Medical University.","1.

These antigens play an important role in conferring pathogenicity to the microorganisms and are also essential in understanding the host pathogen interaction. We have developed an E. coli K antigen 3-dimensional structure database called EK3D, a manually curated database of 72 different E. coli K antigens. As the monosaccharide composition, linkage between the monosaccharides and their stereo isomeric forms differ between different K antigens, the database describes about group classification, capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis & their surface assembly mechanisms along with the structural information about K antigens. The K antigen structures are modeled based on the data derived from methylation studies and 1D (1H and 13C) & 2D NMR spectroscopy. The main purpose of this database is to enable an easy access to a given antigen structure from the listed ek-ids. We have also built K antigen multimer generation provision using rigid multimer modeling and flexible multimer modeling methods. In rigid multimer modeling, fixed inter and intra residue glycosidic torsion angles and a manually optimized helical twist angle are used for K antigen multimer generation. On the other hand, flexible multimer modeling utilizes virtual bond Cartesian coordinate transformation matrices method. In flexible multimer modeling, the user is given the flexibility to choose the desired inter-residue glycosidic torsion angles (phi and psi). These torsion angles are identical for the repeating units and may not represent the global minima of the molecule. Further, these models can serve as a good starting points for modeling studies. The user can generate the multimer by selecting the required K antigen and the preferred number of repeating units.

DBAASP is updated continuously, and at present, version 3.0 (DBAASP v3) contains >15 700 entries (8000 more than the previous version), including >14 500 monomers and nearly 400 homo- and hetero-multimers. Of the monomeric antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), >12 000 are synthetic, about 2700 are ribosomally synthesized, and about 170 are non-ribosomally synthesized. Approximately 3/4 of the entries were added after the initial release of the database in 2014 reflecting the recent sharp increase in interest in AMPs. Despite the increased interest, adoption of peptide antimicrobials in clinical practice is still limited as a consequence of several factors including side effects, problems with bioavailability and high production costs. To assist in developing and optimizing de novo peptides with desired biological activities, DBAASP offers several tools including a sophisticated multifactor analysis of relevant physicochemical properties. Furthermore, DBAASP has implemented a structure modelling pipeline that automates the setup, execution and upload of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of database peptides. At present, >3200 peptides have been populated with MD trajectories and related analyses that are both viewable within the web browser and available for download.

The exponential growth in public high-throughput data offers an opportunity to expand this knowledge. To unlock human-immunology-relevant insight contained in the global biomedical research effort, including all public high-throughput datasets, we performed immunological-pathway-focused Bayesian integration of a comprehensive, heterogeneous compendium comprising 38,088 genome-scale experiments. The distillation of this knowledge into immunological networks of functional relationships between molecular entities (ImmuNet), and tools to mine this resource. The predictive capacity of ImmuNet, established by rigorous statistical validation, is easily accessed by experimentalists to generate data-driven hypotheses. We demonstrate the power of this approach through the identification of unique host-virus interaction responses, and we show how ImmuNet complements genetic studies by predicting disease-associated genes.

Data are deposited in the appropriate EMBL-EBI archives, including the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), ArrayExpress and PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) databases. The project will make 500 cell lines from healthy individuals, and from 150 patients with rare genetic diseases; these will be available through the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC). As of August 2016, 238 cell lines are available for purchase. Project data is presented through the HipSci data portal (http://www.hipsci.org/lines) and is downloadable from the associated FTP site (ftp://ftp.hipsci.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp). The data portal presents a summary matrix of the HipSci cell lines, showing available data types.

The isoelectric point, the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge, is an important parameter for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques, especially for 2D gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), capillary isoelectric focusing, liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry and X-ray protein crystallography. 
The database allows the retrieval of virtual 2D-PAGE plots and the development of customized fractions of proteome based on isoelectric point and molecular weight. Moreover, Proteome-pI facilitates statistical comparisons of the various prediction methods as well as biological investigation of protein isoelectric point space in all kingdoms of life (http://isoelectricpointdb.org/statistics.html). 
The database includes various statistics and tools for interactive browsing, searching and sorting. It can be searched and browsed by organism name, average isoelectric point, molecular weight or amino acid frequencies. Proteins with extreme pI values are also available. For individual proteomes, users can retrieve proteins of interest given the method, isoelectric point and molecular weight ranges (this particular feature can be highly useful to limit potential targets in analysis of 2DPAGE gels or before conducting mass spectrometry). Finally, some general statistics (total number of proteins, amino acids, average sequence length, amino acid and di-amino acid frequencies) and datasets corresponding to major protein databases such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL and the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database have also been precalculated.",,,,Proteomics Resources,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/1988

GigaDB defines a dataset as a group of files (e.g., sequencing data, analyses, imaging files, software programs) that are related to and support an article or study. Through our association with DataCite, each dataset in GigaDB will be assigned a DOI that can be used as a standard citation for future use of these data in other articles by the authors and other researchers. Datasets in GigaDB all require a title that is specific to the dataset, an author list, and an abstract that provides information specific to the data included within the set. 
Datasets that are not affiliated with a GigaScience article are approved for inclusion by the Editors of GigaScience.

The genetic diversity of MENA region has been largely unknown. The recent availability of whole-exome and whole-genome sequences from the region has made it possible to collect population-specific allele frequencies. The integration of data sets from this region would provide insights into the landscape of genetic variants in this region. We integrated genetic variants from multiple data sets systematically, available from this region to create a compendium of over 26 million genetic variations. The variants were systematically annotated and their allele frequencies in the data sets were computed and available as a web interface which enables quick query. As a proof of principle for application of the compendium for genetic epidemiology, we analyzed the allele frequencies for variants in transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) gene, associated with autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis. Our analysis revealed that the carrier frequency of selected variants differed widely with significant interethnic differences.

Early databases were utilized to deposit all lncRNA candidates produced by high-throughput experimental and/or computational techniques to facilitate classification, assessment and validation. As more lncRNAs are validated by low-throughput experiments, several databases were established for experimentally validated lncRNAs. However, these databases are small in scale (with a few hundreds of lncRNAs only) and specific in their focuses (plants, diseases or interactions). Thus, it is highly desirable to have a comprehensive dataset for experimentally validated lncRNAs as a central repository for all of their structures, functions and phenotypes. Here, we established EVLncRNAs by curating lncRNAs validated by low-throughput experiments (up to 1 May 2016) and integrating specific databases (lncRNAdb, LncRANDisease, Lnc2Cancer and PLNIncRBase) with additional functional and disease-specific information not covered previously.

MOs form through liquidâ€“liquid phase separation (LLPS), a process that relies on multivalent weak interactions of the constituent proteins and other macromolecules. Since the first discoveries of certain proteins being able to drive LLPS, it emerged as a general mechanism for the effective organization of cellular space that is exploited in all kingdoms of life. While numerous experimental studies report novel cases, the computational identification of LLPS drivers is lagging behind, and many open questions remain about the sequence determinants, composition, regulation and biological relevance of the resulting condensates. Our limited ability to overcome these issues is largely due to the lack of a dedicated LLPS database. Therefore, here we introduce PhaSePro (https://phasepro.elte.hu), an openly accessible, comprehensive, manually curated database of experimentally validated LLPS driver proteins/protein regions.

In constructing our poly(A) site atlas, we applied uniform quality measures, including the flagging of putative internal priming sites, to input datasets originating from different 3â€™ end sequencing techniques, cell types or tissues. Through integrated processing of all data, we identified and clustered sites that are closely spaced and share polyadenylation signals, as these are likely the result of stochastic variations in processing. For each cluster, we identified the representative - most frequently processed - site and estimated the relative use in the transcriptome across all samples. While other existing alternative polyadenylation databases rely on a single experimental method, or on poly(A) site estimation from RNA-seq data, PolyASite is built on data from several 3â€™ end sequencing techniques.

Enhancers, as well as their associated target genes, and transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, are highly associated with human disease and biological processes. Although some enhancer databases have been published, most only focus on enhancers identified by high-throughput experimental techniques. Therefore, it is highly desirable to construct a comprehensive resource of manually curated enhancers and their related information based on low-throughput experimental evidences. Here, we established a comprehensive manually-curated enhancer database for human and mouse, which provides a resource for experimentally supported enhancers, and to annotate the detailed information of enhancers. The current release of ENdb documents 737 experimentally validated enhancers and their related information, including 384 target genes, 263 TFs, 110 diseases and 153 functions in human and mouse. Moreover, the enhancer-related information was supported by experimental evidences, such as RNAi, in vitro knockdown, western blotting, qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter assay, chromatin conformation capture (3C) and chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) assays.

In addition to energetics of allosteric signaling between known functional and regulatory sites, allosteric modulation caused by the binding to these sites, by SNPs, and by mutations designated by the user can be explored. Allosteric Signaling Maps (ASMs), which are produced via the exhaustive computational scanning for stabilizing and destabilizing mutations and for the modulation range caused by the sequence position are available for each protein/protein chain in the database.

However, due to the lack of efficient collection, standardized quality control, and analysis procedures, efficiently integrating and reusing these data remain considerable challenges. Here, we introduce CFEA (http://www.bio-data.cn/CFEA), a cell-free epigenome database dedicated to three types of widely adopted epigenetic modifications (5mC, 5hmC and NP) involved in 27 human diseases. We developed bioinformatic pipelines for quality control and standard data processing and an easy-to-use web interface to facilitate the query, visualization and download of these cell-free epigenome data. We also manually curated related biological and clinical information for each profile, allowing users to better browse and compare cfDNA epigenomes at a specific stage (such as early- or metastasis-stage) of cancer development.

Gene expression profile analysis before and after knockdown or knockout is one of the most important strategies for obtaining target genes of TFs and exploring TF functions. Human gene expression profile datasets with TF knockdown and knockout are accumulating rapidly. Based on the urgent need to comprehensively and effectively collect and process these data, we developed KnockTF (http://www.licpathway.net/KnockTF/index.html), a comprehensive human gene expression profile database of TF knockdown and knockout. KnockTF provides a number of resources for human gene expression profile datasets associated with TF knockdown and knockout and annotates TFs and their target genes in a tissue/cell type-specific manner. The current version of KnockTF has 570 manually curated RNA-seq and microarray datasets associated with 308 TFs disrupted by different knockdown and knockout techniques and across multiple tissue/cell types. KnockTF collects upstream pathway information of TFs and functional annotation results of downstream target genes. It provides details about TFs binding to promoters, super-enhancers and typical enhancers of target genes. KnockTF constructs a TF-differentially expressed gene network and performs network analyses for genes of interest.

New strategies for detecting spatial gene expression patterns are emerging, and spatially resolved transcriptomic data are accumulating rapidly. However, it is not convenient for biologists to exploit these data due to the diversity of strategies and complexity in data analysis. Here, we present SpatialDB, the first manually curated database for spatially resolved transcriptomic techniques and datasets. The current version of SpatialDB contains 24 datasets (305 sub-datasets) from 5 species generated by 8 spatially resolved transcriptomic techniques. SpatialDB provides a user-friendly web interface for visualization and comparison of spatially resolved transcriptomic data. To further explore these data, SpatialDB also provides spatially variable genes and their functional enrichment annotation. SpatialDB offers a repository for research community to investigate the spatial cellular structure of tissues, and may bring new insights into understanding the cellular microenvironment in disease.",,,,Nucleotide Sequence Databases,Transcriptional regulator sites and transcription factors,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz934

Yet, existing tRNA databases have not been updated for more than a decade, so they do not contain this new functional information and have not kept pace with the rate of discovery in this field. Therefore, a regularly updated database that contains information about newly discovered characteristics of tRNA molecules and can be regularly updated is strongly needed. The T-psi-C database is an up-to-date collection of tRNA sequences (1030 sequences at the publication date). This database also contains 3D tRNA structures obtained from Protein Data Bank and generated using homology modeling. The T-psi-C database can be continuously updated by any member of the scientific community, and contains its own application programming interface (API), which allows users to retrieve or upload data in JSON format. Altogether, T-psi-C is user-friendly, easy to develop and an up-to-date source of knowledge about tRNAs.

In SSRome database, 158,041,204 microsatellite DNA motifs were identified across all annotated genomes of Plants, Metazoa, Archaea, Bacteria, Viruses, Fungi and Protozoa. In addition to all annotated Mitochondrial and Chloroplast genomes and all available NCBI ESTs till March 2018, represent collectively 6533 living organisms. This huge number of identified SSRs motifs were detected based on analysis of 300,159,904,537 bases of DNA. Moreover, a total of 45,109,613 SSR primer pairs were designed and classified in two main categories (genic or non-genic primers) according to their localization. All stored datasets can be downloaded freely in very convenient way. In addition to the SSRome database, SSRome provide three user-friendly in-house pipelines, can help scientists\users to identify, classify and compare microsatellite motifs in both genomic and transcriptomic-wide levels. This developed SSRome pipelines comes into three functional modules, to cover different types of SSRs mining analysis. The modules including â€˜SSRome Genomic Pipeline', 'SSRome Transcriptomic Pipeline' and 'SSRome Comparative Analysis Pipeline'.",,The authors would like to thank the administration of Agricultural Genetic Engineering Research Institute (AGERI) as well as the administration of the Agricultural Research Center (ARC) for their continued support.,,Organelle databases,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky998

ZFIN curators manually curate and integrate comprehensive data involving zebrafish genes, mutants, transgenics, phenotypes, genotypes, gene expressions, morpholinos, antibodies, anatomical structures and publications. Integrated views of these data, as well as data gathered through collaborations and data exchanges, are provided through a wide selection of web-based search forms. Among the vertebrate model organisms, zebrafish are uniquely well suited for rapid and targeted generation of mutant lines. The recent rapid production of mutants and transgenic zebrafish is making management of data associated with these resources particularly important to the research community. Here, we describe recent enhancements to ZFIN aimed at improving our support for mutant and transgenic lines, including (i) enhanced mutant/transgenic search functionality; (ii) more expressive phenotype curation methods; (iii) new downloads files and archival data access; (iv) incorporation of new data loads from laboratories undertaking large-scale generation of mutant or transgenic lines and (v) new GBrowse tracks for transgenic insertions, genes with antibodies and morpholinos.",,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa1010

AnimalTFDB is a comprehensive database including classification and annotation of genome-wide transcription factors (TFs), transcription co-factors and chromatin remodeling factors in animal genomes. The TFs are further classified into 70 families based on their conserved DBDs. The AnimalTFDB 1.0 predicted TFs in 50 animal genomes and it was online in 2011. In 2014, we updated the database to version 2.0 as many more annotation data and new genome sequences available. In AnimalTFDB 2.0, we identified 72336 TF genes, 21053 transcription co-factor genes, and 6502 chromatin remodeling factor genes from 65 species covering main animal lineages. Abundant annotations, such as gene basic information, protein functional domain, gene ontology, pathway, protein-protein interaction, ortholog, paralog and gene model are provided. Besides that, we also made several new features and functions. These includes (1) gene expression from RNA-Seq for 9 model species, (2) gene phenotype information, (3) multiple sequence alignment of TF DNA-binding domains, and the weblogo and phylogenetic tree based on the alignment, (4) a TF prediction server to identify new TFs from input sequences, and (5) a BLAST server to search against TFs in AnimalTFDB.

Here we present a web-accessible database, named APASdb (http://mosas.sysu.edu.cn/utr), which can visualize the precise map and usage quantification of different APA isoforms for all genes. The datasets are deeply profiled by the sequencing alternative polyadenylation sites (SAPAS) method capable of high-throughput sequencing 3'-ends of polyadenylated transcripts. Thus, APASdb details all the heterogeneous cleavage sites downstream of poly(A) signals, and maintains near complete coverage for APA sites, much better than the previous databases using conventional methods. Furthermore, APASdb provides the quantification of a given APA variant among transcripts with different APA sites by computing their corresponding normalized-reads, making our database more useful. In addition, APASdb supports URL-based retrieval, browsing and display of exon-intron structure, poly(A) signals, poly(A) sites location and usage reads, and 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs). Currently, APASdb involves APA in various biological processes and diseases in human, mouse and zebrafish.",,"We thank the members of our laboratories for discussion and data processing.

In addition to comprehensive data from Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica sequenced by BGI, BGI-RIS also hosts carefully curated genome information from Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica and EST sequences available from other cereal crops. In this resource, sequence contigs of indica (93-11) have been further assembled into Mbp-sized scaffolds and anchored onto the rice chromosomes referenced to physical/genetic markers, cDNAs and BAC-end sequences. We have annotated the rice genomes for gene content, repetitive elements, gene duplications (tandem and segmental) and single nucleotide polymorphisms between rice subspecies. Designed as a basic platform, BGI-RIS presents the sequenced genomes and related information in systematic and graphical ways for the convenience of in-depth comparative studies.",,"Most of this work was jointly sponsored by Chinese Academy of Sciences, Commission for Economy Planning, Ministry of Science and Technology and National Natural Science Foundation of China.","1.

National Center for Biotechnology-CSIC. Madrid, Spain",pascual@cnb.csic.es,"We present the second generation of centrosomeDB, available online at http://centrosome.cnb.csic.es, with a significant expansion of 1357 human and drosophila centrosomal genes and their corresponding information. The centrosome of animal cells takes part in important biological processes such as the organization of the interphase microtubule cytoskeleton and the assembly of the mitotic spindle. The active research done during the past decades has produced lots of data related to centrosomal proteins. Unfortunately, the accumulated data is dispersed among diverse and heterogeneous sources of information. We believe that the availability of a repository collecting curated evidences of centrosomal proteins would constitute a key resource for the scientific community. This was our first motivation to introduce CentrosomeDB in NAR database issue in 2009, collecting a set of human centrosomal proteins that were reported in the literature and other sources. The intensive use of this resource during these years has encouraged us to present this new expanded version. Using our database, the researcher is offered the possibility to study the evolution, function, and structure of the centrosome. We have compiled information from many sources, including Gene Ontology, disease-association, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and associated gene expression experiments. Special interest has been paid to protein-protein interaction.","In this new version of CentrosomeDB the set of human centrosomal genes was significantly amplified to 1053, being a solid improvement against the 383 genes of the first version. In addition to this, we also collected 304 Drosophila melanogaster genes likely to be localized in the centrosome, which comes towards the â€œfuture perspectivesâ€ of the first version â€“ to widen the range of species of CentrosomeDB. There were also some changes in the way information can be treated, with the interactions becoming the focus of this new generation. In fact, our updated database allows the user to obtain the interactome of a set of any genes against the centrosomal genes, the genes located to the â€œnuclear membraneâ€ and the â€œGolgi apparatusâ€ and the genes involved in the cell-cycle progression like the CDK's and the cyclins. With this new version, the user can recreate any interaction's user case using the tools provided by CentrosomeDB exclusively, and make a full interactions centric study of any centrosomal gene in particular.",This work was supported by the Government of Madrid (CAM) [P2010/BMD-2305]; the Spanish Minister of Science and Innovation [BIO2010-17527]; and the Juan de la Cierva research program [to RNC].

Recent studies discovered that lysine acetylation targets broad substrates and especially plays an essential role in cellular metabolic regulation. Although acetylation is comparable with other major PTMs such as phosphorylation, an integrated resource still remains to be developed. In this work, we presented the CPLA (Compendium of Protein Lysine Acetylation, http://cpla.biocuckoo.org) database for lysine acetylated substrates with their sites. From the scientific literature, we manually collected 7,151 experimentally identified acetylation sites in 3,311 targets. Combined with protein-protein interaction (PPI) information, we systematically discovered a potential human lysine acetylation network (HLAN) among histone acetyltransferases (HATs), substrates and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In particular, there are 1,862 triplet relationships of HAT-substrate-HDAC retrieved from the HLAN, at least 13 of which were previously experimentally verified.

CSDBase - Cold Shock Domain database,https://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/summary/364,http://www.molecular-systems.org/csdbase/,"Weber, M.H.W., Doll, N., Marahiel, M.A.","Philipps-UniversitÃ„t Marburg, FB Chemie, Hans-Meerwein-Str., D-35032 Marburg, Germany",weberm@staff.uni-marburg.de,"CSDBase (http://www.chemie.uni-marburg.de/~csdbase/) is an interactive Internet-embedded research platform providing detailed information on cold shock domain-containing proteins and bacterial cold shock responses. In its second release, access to CSDBase is completely independent of a specific computer system and/or browser and care has been taken to fully preserve the outfit and user interfaces of the initial version to provide convenient usage. In addition to the updated literature references, protein information and CSD-containing protein structure model content present in CSDBase, we have integrated a new database subcore harboring the entire results of the first DNA macroarray study of cold shocked Bacillus subtilis cells. These data can be searched and ranked according to multiple features such as gene name, gene expression at 37Â°C or 15Â°C, cold-induction factor, etc. and comprise all genes of the B. subtilis genome. On the basis of the flexible architecture of CSDBase we would like to invite researches from other work groups to integrate their data into this database after publication in order to (i) establish a central archive for world-wide accessible DNA array results of cold shocked bacteria, and (ii) overcome the usually reduced information content of array data publications that results from space limitations in scientific journals.","Since the initial release of CSDBase in January 2002 (Weber et al., 2002), many exciting new reports concerning nucleic acid binding proteins harboring the cold shock domain (CSD) have been published and were incorporated in the extended version of our current CSDBase literature retrieval subsystem. These reports describe the discovery of the first archaeal cold shock protein encoding DNA sequence (Beja et al., 2002) as well as the cloning, purification and biochemical characterization of the first eukaryotic cold shock protein Cla h 8 from Cladosporium herbarum (Falsone et al., 2002). Moreover, a number of previously determined bacterial cold shock protein structure coordinate files have now become available in the relevant protein structure databases (Delbruck et al., 2001, Kremer et al., 2001) and the first structure of a CSD from a Y-box protein has been solved (Kloks et al., 2002). Together with the previously available structural information on CSD-containing proteins, these extended data sets are currently used to re-calculate the complete CSD structure model collection that has been presented in the initial version of CSDBase (Weber et al., 2002). A newly performed sequence data acquisition has furthermore revealed that the number of known CSD-containing protein sequences has approximately doubled compared to what was known in January 2000. Also, according to these data it appears that CSD-containing proteins represent only a minor fraction of the plant glycine-rich protein family whose members predominantly possess the RBD/RRM motif(s). In addition to a regularly performed update of the CSDBase data content, the current release was designed to focus on two major improvements. These were (i) the conversion of CSDBase into a platform- and browser-independent environment to address a much broader scientific community, and (ii) the integration of a novel database subcore providing additional scientific data concerning bacterial cold shock responses. As a result, the new release of CSDBase does no longer require Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 5 or higher) as was the case with the previous version and now runs completely independent of a specific computer system and/or browser. Care has been taken to fully preserve the outfit and user interfaces of the initial release to provide convenient usage. Moreover, a new database subcore has been created that contains the entire DNA macroarray results from our recently published transcriptomic investigation of the cold shock response in Bacillus subtilis (Beckering et al., 2002). These data can be searched and ranked according to multiple features such as gene name, gene expression at 37Â°C or 15Â°C, cold-induction factor, etc. and comprise all genes of the B. subtilis genome. To initiate the establishment of a central location for the deposition of such world-wide accessible bacterial cold shock response-related DNA array data, we hereby invite researchers from other workgroups to contact us in order to integrate their data in a separate CSDBase database subcore of similar structure. Each database subcore can be password protected until the original data has been published elsewhere.

Since dogs are one of the most thoroughly domesticated animals, this has made them a long-term focus and perfect model for domestication genetics studies. Furthermore, their parallel evolution with humans has facilitated our understanding of human evolution itself. However, currently the most widely used dog single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dataset is from dbSNP (build139:ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/), where ~80% of the ~2.7M SNPs were called from only two dogs, one Boxer(1) and one Standard Poodle(2). dbSNP only provides a total SNP list, combining SNPs from all samples, and does not have individual lists, which limits its usability in population genetic analysis. The rapid development of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has facilitated the generation of massive dog/wolf genome datasets. However, SNP calling from the massive data generated by NGS is very laborious and requires a large amount of computational resources. This situation has promoted us to establish a canidae specific database (DoGSD) that focuses on whole genome SNP data from domesticated dogs and grey wolves. We collected SNPs from 2 unpublished dog/wolf genomes, 3 recently published works (3-5) that used 75 dog/wolf samples and the latest dog SNP dataset (dbSNP139). In total, DoGSD includes 8 grey wolves sampled from the Eurasian continent and America, 34 Chinese indigenous dogs from China, 34 breed dogs representing 5 breeds and 1 Dingo. Dogs from the 5 breeds include 11 German Shepherd dogs (Germany), 10 Kunming dogs (China), 11 Tibetan Mastiffs (China), 1 Belgian Malinois (Belgium), and 1 Basenji (Congo). The 34 Chinese indigenous dogs in our samples represent a key phase in dog domestication and are not included in any existing SNP database. DoGSD provides a powerful SNP retrieval interface that can extract data for each individual sample as well as a non-redundant dataset. SNPs are annotated to integrate information such as SNP-related genes, transcripts, proteins, and allows calculation of allele frequencies. DoGSD functionality includes the ability to search for gene-related synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs. In addition, we incorporate the essential genetic statistics viz. F- statistics (Fst) into DoGSD.","The DoGSD database can be accessed through a simple user interfaces. There are 2 main functionalities designed into DoGSD for data retrieval: Browse and Search. Users may browse the non-redundant or individual sample SNPs either as text format in tables, or in a chromosome based graphical GBrowse interface. Sample information, SNP-related genes, transcripts, proteins, allele frequency, Fst values, synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs summary tables can be retrieved through the Browse and the Search interfaces. Comparative searches for SNPs between two or more individuals are also implemented. Moreover, all SNP data (individual or non-redundant set) can be freely downloaded as tab-delimited files and bam/fastq/sra format files for the 75 cited samples provided.","We thank all group members of DoGSD for sample collection, sequencing, SNP calling, annotation, database release and management.

The annotated first exons of human and Arabidopsis thaliana genes were used as queries in BLAST searches to collect the most closely related orthologous first exon sequences from Chordata and Viridiplantae species. Up to 3000 bp DNA segments upstream from these first exons constitute the clusters in the chordate and plant sections of the Database of Orthologous Promoters. Release 1.0 of DoOP contains 21061 chordate clusters from 284 different species and 7548 plant clusters from 269 different species. The database can be used to find and retrieve promoter sequences of a given gene from various species and it is also suitable to see the most trivial conserved sequence blocks in the orthologous upstream regions. Users can search DoOP with either sequence or text (annotation) to find promoter clusters of various genes. In addition to the sequence data, the positions of the conserved sequence blocks derived from multiple alignments, the positions of repetitive elements and the positions of transcription start sites known from the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) can be viewed graphically.

Our group at the Center for Computational Genomics and Bioinformatics (University of Minnesota) aims to contribute to the annotation of forest tree sequences through collaborations with groups involved in forestry research. The database will be continuously enriched with other sequence resources and new features in the future. Its purpose is to make sequence annotation available for the wide community of biologists involved in tree research, and to provide a flexible interface for developing queries.
We have developed an annotation pipeline making use of several publicly available software and sequence repositories. We applied the annotation procedure to several EST collections obtained in conifer and poplar species. Unifying data related to several EST projects, the ForestTreeDB database is dedicated to store and handle these sequence and annotation data. The aim of this work was to produce an extensive EST database for tree species with links to other related plant resources.
ForestTreeDB currently encompasses 344,878 quality sequences based on 68 libraries, from diverse organs of conifer and hybrid poplar trees. It utilizes the Nimbus data model to provide a hosting system for multiple projects, and uses object-relational mapping APIs in Java and Perl for data accesses within an Oracle database. The database is designed to be scalable, maintainable and extendable. Transcriptome builds or unigene sets occupy the focal point of the system. Several of the five current species specific unigenes were used to design microarrays and SNP resources. The ForestTreeDB web application provides the means for multiple combinations of database queries. It presents the user with a list of discrete queries to retrieve and download large EST datasets or sequences from pre-compiled unigene assemblies. Functional annotation assignment is not trivial in conifers which are distantly related to angiosperm model plants. Optimal annotations are achieved through database queries that integrate results from several procedures based open-source tools.

IMGT/LIGM-DB is the first and the largest database of IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system® (2,3), the high-quality integrated knowledge resource specialized in IG, TR, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of human and other vertebrate species, and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and to the MHC superfamily (MhcSF). IMGT/LIGM-DB sequence data are identified by the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession number. The unique source of data for IMGT/LIGM-DB is EMBL which shares data with GenBank and DDBJ. Once the sequences are allowed by the authors to be made public, LIGM receives IG and TR sequences from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). After control by LIGM curators, data are scanned to store sequences, bibliographical references and taxonomic data, and standardized IMGT/LIGM-DB keywords are assigned to all entries. Based on expert analysis (4,5) and on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY axioms and concepts (6,7), specific detailed annotations are added to IMGT flat files in a second step. The IMGT/LIGM-DB Web interface allows searches according to immunogenetic criteria and is easy to use without any knowledge of a computing language. All IMGT/LIGM-DB information is available through five modules of search: Catalogue, Taxonomy and characteristics, Keywords, Annotation labels, References. The current selection is displayed at the top of the resulting sequences pages, so users can check their own queries. It is possible to modify the request or to consult the results. Selecting the ""View"" option provides a list of resulting sequences. Selection of one sequence in the list offers eight possibilities: annotations, IMGT flat file, coding regions with protein translation, catalogue and external references, sequence in dump format, sequence in FASTA format, sequence with three reading frames and EMBL flat file. Selecting the ""Subsequences"" option allows users to search for sequence fragments (subsequences) corresponding to a particular label for the resulting sequences (available for fully annotated sequences). IMGT/LIGM-DB data are also distributed by anonymous FTP servers at CINES (ftp://ftp.cines.fr/IMGT/) and at EBI (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/imgt/), and from many SRS (Sequence Retrieval System) sites. IMGT/LIGM-DB can be searched by BLAST or FASTA on different servers (e.g., EBI, IGH, Institut Pasteur). In April 2008, IMGT/LIGM-DB contained 122,425 sequences of IG and TR from human and 221 other vertebrate species.",IMGT/Automat (8) is a tool which allows the automatic annotation of human and mouse cDNAs in IMGT/LIGM-DB using the results from IMGT/V-QUEST (9) and IMGT/JunctionAnalysis (10).,"IMGT® received funding from the European Union (EU) programmes BIOMED1 (BIOCT930038), BIOTECH2 (BIO4CT960037), 5th PCRDT (QLG2-2000-01287) and 6th PCRDT (ImmunoGrid IST-028069), from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche ANR (BIOSYS06-135457) and from the Région Languedoc-Roussillon.

They function as key regulators of a number of biological functions, prominently in signal transduction and coordination of complex processes such as cell cycle and embryonic development [1]. Mutations and dysregulation of protein kinases play causal roles in the onset of multiple human diseases and thus serve as potential drug targets. 
KinG (Kinases encoded in Genomes) is a comprehensive collection of Ser/Thr/Tyr specific protein kinases and similar sequences encoded in the completed genomes of eukaryotes prokaryotes and viruses [2]. The full complement of protein kinases in various completely sequenced genomes hosted at (http://king.mbu.iisc.ernet.in) provides a detailed listing of the Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases in various organisms, accompanied by other features such as protein kinase subfamily classification and domain organization. The kinases in the database are classified based on the Hanks and Hunter group classification [3].  The database enables the retrieval of protein kinases using several search option and also kinases belonging to specified subfamily or with a specific domain combination. It also hosts an in-house program for identifying if an input sequence is likely to be a kinase or not. 
Protein kinases were identified using a combination of multiple profile search approaches such as RPS-BLAST and hidden Markov model (HMM) matching using Hmmscan which have been previously benchmarked and used in our earlier kinome analysis for several other genomes [2,4,5]. Conditions for identification of homologues/kinases in RPS-BLAST searches include an e-value cut off of 0.0001 and a 70% query coverage. E-value cut off used for HMM based search was 0.01. Further, curation of protein kinases has been done based on presence of the conserved catalytic aspartate residue.","The current version of the KinG encodes kinases from 417 eukaryotes, 11394 prokaryotes (including strains) and also 389 viruses with complete genome sequence information available in the Uniprot database. The database is enriched with over 130000 kinases gleaned from these genomes.  Searches can be made for taxon identifier, Uniprot accession number, subfamily name and domain architecture. A sequence based search is also facilitated where the user provided sequence is searched for its similarity with known kinases and also the presence of the catalytic aspartate residue to identify if it could be a kinase. Domain architecture of the recognized kinase is also reported.","This research is supported by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, New Delhi to N.S.","1.

SynDB might serve as a repository for current knowledge as well as a starting point for future neurobiological and neuroinformatic research.
To describe synaptic structures and functions we have developed Synapse Ontology (SynO). SynDB can be interactively browsed by Synapse Ontology, Gene Ontology, domain families, species, chromosomal locations, or Tribe-MCL clusters.  It can also be searched by text (including Boolean operators) or by sequence similarity.  To our knowledge, SynDB is the first focused yet comprehensive database for synaptic proteins.",,"We are grateful to all the collaboraters, who reviewed our database and gave us kind advice.","1.

Initially, it contains 36 individual genomic data sets that have been analyzed and reported by the Genomic Medicine Institute (GMI) at Seoul National University (1,2,3). TIARA improves the accuracy of detecting personal genomic variations, such as SNPs, short indels, and structural variants (SVs). TIARA supports a user-friendly genome browser, which retrieves read-depths (RDs) and log2 ratios from NGS and CGH arrays, respectively. In addition, TIARA provides information on all genomic variants and the raw data, including short reads and feature-level CGH data, through anonymous file transfer protocol (FTP).","Recently, the genome browser of TIARA has the functions of displaying SNPs, indels, Read Depths (RD) with Refseq genes from high-throughput sequencing, copy number variants (CNVS) regions and log2 ratio for high-resolution CGH array. Moreover, a genome-wide map summarizing the location and allele frequency for each SNPs can be found in TIARA. In detail, massively parallel sequencing data from six Korean genomes (AK3, AK5, AK7, AK9, AK14, and AK20) were sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx and deposited in TIARA. In addition, genomic variants such SNPs, indels, and CNV regions and read RDs for those data were also browsed and downloaded in genome browser of TIARA.","TIARA was supported by the Korean Ministry of Knowledge Economy [grant number 0411-20100061], the Korean Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology [grant number 2010-0013662], Green Cross Therapeutics [grant number 0411-20080023].

Recently, tmRNA-like molecules have been discovered also in certain bacteriphages. To assist in the study of structure and function of tmRNA, the tmRNA database (tmRDB) lists the known tmRNA sequences ordered alphabetically and phylogenetically with links to the primary sources. The tmRNA alignment, available in various formats, is the basis for supported tmRNA secondary structures. Three-dimensional models in pdb format generated by ERNA-3D [2] help to investigate potential interactions between the tmRNA and its cofactors. Aligned sequences of tmRNA-encoded tag-peptides which serve as signals for cellular proteases, are included. The tmRDB also provides relevant information about the proteins known to interact with tmRNA such as SmpB, ribosomal protein S1, alanyl-tRNA synthetase, and elongation factor Tu,. The tmRDB is maintained at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler, Texas, and accessible on the World Wide Web at the URL http://psyche.uthct.edu/dbs/tmRDB/tmRDB.html.
